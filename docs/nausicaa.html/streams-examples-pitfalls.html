<h4 class="subsection">42.14.6 Pitfalls</h4>

<p>Programming with streams, or any lazy evaluator, can be tricky, even for
programmers experienced in the genre.  Programming with streams is even
worse in Scheme than in a purely functional language, because, though
the streams are lazy, the surrounding Scheme expressions in which they
are embedded are eager.  The impedance between lazy and eager can
occasionally lead to astonishing results.  Thirty&ndash;two years ago,
William Burge warned:

   <blockquote>
Some care must be taken when a stream is produced to make sure that its
elements are not really a list in disguise, in other words, to make sure
that the stream elements are not materialized too soon. 
</blockquote>

   <p>For example, a simple version of <code>stream-map</code> that returns a stream
built by applying a unary procedure to the elements of an input stream
could be defined like this:

<pre class="example">     (define-stream (stream-map proc strm) ;wrong!
       (let loop ([strm strm])
         (if (stream-null? strm)
             stream-null
           (stream-cons
             (proc (stream-car strm))
             (loop (stream-cdr strm))))))
</pre>
   <p>That looks right.  It properly wraps the procedure in
<code>stream-lambda</code>, and the two legs of the <code>if</code> both return
streams, so it type&ndash;checks.  But it fails because the named <code>let</code>
binds <var>loop</var> to a procedure using normal <code>lambda</code> rather than
<code>stream-lambda</code>, so even though the first element of the result
stream is lazy, subsequent elements are eager.  <code>stream-map</code> can be
written using <code>stream-let</code>:

<pre class="example">     (define-stream (stream-map proc strm)
       (stream-let loop ([strm strm])
         (if (stream-null? strm)
             stream-null
           (stream-cons
             (proc (stream-car strm))
             (loop (stream-cdr strm))))))
</pre>
   <p>Here, <code>stream-let</code> assures that each element of the result stream
is properly delayed, because each is subject to the <code>stream-lambda</code>
that is implicit in <code>stream-let</code>, so the result is truly a stream,
not a &ldquo;list in disguise&rdquo;.  Another version of this procedure was given
previously at the description of <code>define-stream</code>.

   <p>Another common problem occurs when a stream&ndash;valued procedure requires
the next stream element in its definition.  Consider this definition of
<code>stream-unique</code>:

<pre class="example">     (define-stream (stream-unique eql? strm) ;wrong!
       (stream-match strm
         [() strm]
         [(_) strm]
         [(a b . _)
          (if (eql? a b)
              (stream-unique eql?
                (stream-cdr strm))
            (stream-cons a
              (stream-unique eql?
                (stream-cdr strm))))]))
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">the <code>(a b . _)</code> pattern requires the value of the next stream
element after the one being considered.  Thus, to compute the nth
element of the stream, one must know the n+1st element, and to compute
the n+1st element, one must know the n+2nd element, and to compute... 
The correct version, given above in the description of
<code>stream-drop-while</code>, only needs the current stream element.

   <p>A similar problem occurs when the stream expression uses the previous
element to compute the current element:

<pre class="example">     (define (nat n)
       (stream-ref
         (stream-let loop ([s (stream 0)])
           (stream-cons (stream-car s)
             (loop (stream (add1 (stream-car s))))))
         n))
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">this program traverses the stream of natural numbers, building the
stream as it goes.  The definition is correct: <code>(nat 15)</code> evaluates
to 15; but it needlessly uses unbounded space because each stream
element holds the value of the prior stream element in the binding to
<var>s</var>.

   <p>When traversing a stream, it is easy to write the expression in such a
way that evaluation requires unbounded space, even when that is not
strictly necessary.  During the discussion of <acronym>SRFI</acronym>-40, Joe Marshall
created this infamous procedure:

<pre class="example">     (define (times3 n)
       (stream-ref
         (stream-filter
           (lambda (x)
             (zero? (modulo x n)))
           (stream-from 0))
         3))
</pre>
   <p class="noindent"><code>(times3 5)</code> evaluates to 15 and <code>(times3 #e1e9)</code> evaluates to
three billion, though it takes a while.  In either case, <code>times3</code>
should operate in bounded space, since each iteration mutates the
promise that holds the next value.  But it is easy to write
<code>times3</code> so that it does not operate in bounded space, as the
follies of <acronym>SRFI</acronym>-40 showed.

   <p>The common problem is that some element of the stream (often the first
element) is bound outside the expression that is computing the stream,
so it holds the head of the stream, which holds the second element, and
so on.  In addition to testing the programmer, this procedure tests the
stream primitives (it caught several errors during development) and also
tests the underlying Scheme system (it found a bug in one
implementation).

   <p>Laziness is no defense against an infinite loop; for instance, the
expression below never returns, because the <code>odd?</code> predicate never
finds an odd stream element.

<pre class="example">     (stream-null?
       (stream-filter odd?
         (stream-from 0 2)))
</pre>
   <p>Ultimately, streams are defined as promises, which are implemented as
thunks (lambda with no arguments).  Since a stream is a procedure,
comparisons such as <code>eq?</code>, <code>eqv?</code> and <code>equal?</code> are not
meaningful when applied to streams.  For instance, the expression

<pre class="example">     (define s ((stream-lambda () stream-null)))
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">defines <var>s</var> as the null stream, and <code>(stream-null? s)</code> is
<code>#t</code>, but <code>(eq?  s stream-null)</code> is <code>#f</code>.

   <p>To determine if two streams are equal, it is necessary to evaluate the
elements in their common prefixes, reporting <code>#f</code> if two elements
ever differ and <code>#t</code> if both streams are exhausted at the same time.

<pre class="example">     (define (stream-equal? eql? xs ys)
       (cond [(and (stream-null? xs)
                   (stream-null? ys)) #t]
             [(or (stream-null? xs)
                  (stream-null? ys)) #f]
             [(not (eql? (stream-car xs)
                         (stream-car ys))) #f]
             [else (stream-equal? eql?
                     (stream-cdr xs)
                     (stream-cdr ys))]))
</pre>
   <p>It is generally not a good idea to mix lazy streams with eager
side&ndash;effects, because the order in which stream elements are evaluated
determines the order in which the side&ndash;effects occur.  For a simple
example, consider this side&ndash;effecting version of <code>strm123</code>:

<pre class="example">     (define strm123-with-side-effects
       (stream-cons (begin (display "one") 1)
         (stream-cons (begin (display "two") 2)
           (stream-cons (begin (display "three") 3)
             stream-null))))
</pre>
   <p>The stream has elements <code>1 2 3</code>.  But depending on the order in
which stream elements are accessed, <code>"one"</code>, <code>"two"</code> and
<code>"three"</code> could be printed in any order.

   <p>Since the performance of streams can be very poor, normal (eager) lists
should be preferred to streams unless there is some compelling reason to
the contrary.  For instance, computing pythagorean triples with streams:

<pre class="example">     (stream-ref
       (stream-of (list a b c)
         (n in (stream-from 1))
         (a in (stream-range 1 n))
         (b in (stream-range a n))
         (c is (- n a b))
         (= (+ (* a a) (* b b)) (* c c)))
       50)
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">is about two orders of magnitude slower than the equivalent expression
using loops:

<pre class="example">     (do ([n 1 (+ n 1)]) ([&gt; n 228])
       (do ([a 1 (+ a 1)]) ([&gt; a n])
         (do ([b a (+ b 1)]) ([&gt; b n])
           (let ([c (- n a b)])
             (if (= (+ (* a a) (* b b)) (* c c))
                 (display (list a b c)))))))
</pre>
