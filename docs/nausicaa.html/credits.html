This document describes version 0.2d5 of Nausicaa/Scheme, a set of
Scheme libraries defining a slightly modified R6RS Scheme language
and augmenting the features of the base and standard R6RS libraries.

The project home page of Nausicaa is at:

<h2 class="appendix">Appendix D Credits</h2>

<p>This appendix collects license notices and copyright assignments for
code and documentation included in Nausicaa/Scheme.

<h5 class="subsubheading">Language and implementations</h5>

<p>Scheme is a statically scoped and properly tail&ndash;recursive dialect of
the Lisp programming language invented by Guy Lewis Steele Jr. and
Gerald Jay Sussman.  It was designed to have an exceptionally clear and
simple semantics and few different ways to form expressions.

   <p>Several libraries depend upon the port to <acronym>R6RS</acronym> of the Scheme
Requests For Implementation (<acronym>SRFI</acronym>).  The original <acronym>SRFI</acronym> code is the
work of many authors, reference of which you can find the at the top of
the source code files; the port to <acronym>R6RS</acronym> included in this project is
the work of Derick Eddington.

It is the creation of Taro Minowa (higepon).

     <br><dt><code>Petite Chez Scheme</code><dd>An also <acronym>R6RS</acronym> compliant implementation of the Scheme programming
language.  It is produced by Cadence Research Systems.

     <br><dt><code>Racket</code><dd>A distribution of languages and libraries with support for <acronym>R6RS</acronym>.  It
is the work of many people (see the website).

     <br><dt><code>Vicare</code><dd>An experimental fork of Ikarus.  Ikarus is an almost <acronym>R6RS</acronym> compliant
implementation of the Scheme programming language.  It is the creation
of Abdulaziz Ghuloum.

     <br><dt><code>Ypsilon</code><dd>An <acronym>R6RS</acronym> compliant implementation of the Scheme programming language. 
It is the creation of Yoshikatsu Fujita at LittleWing Company.

   <p>Nausicaa/Scheme is the creation of Marco Maggi.  If this work exists, it
is because of the <acronym>GNU</acronym> Software tools he uses all the time.

<h5 class="subsubheading">Documentation: language definition, base and standard library</h5>

<p>The chapters <a href="scheme.html#scheme">The Scheme language</a>, <a href="baselib.html#baselib">Base library</a> and <a href="stdlib.html#stdlib">Standard library</a> are derived from the original
&ldquo;Revised^6 Report on the Algorithmic Language Scheme&rdquo; document and the
original &ldquo;Revised^6 Report on the Algorithmic Language Scheme &mdash;&ndash;
Standard Libraries&rdquo;, authored by the following people:

   <blockquote>
MICHAEL SPERBER<br>
R. KENT DYBVIG, MATTHEW FLATT, ANTON VAN STRAATEN<br>
(Editors)

<p class="noindent">RICHARD KELSEY, WILLIAM CLINGER, JONATHAN REES<br>
(Editors, Revised^5 Report on the Algorithmic Language Scheme)

<p class="noindent">ROBERT BRUCE FINDLER, JACOB MATTHEWS<br>
(Authors, formal semantics)
</blockquote>

<p class="noindent">with various contributions by the following people:

   <blockquote>
Hal Abelson, Norman Adams, David Bartley, Gary Brooks, William Clinger,
Daniel Friedman, Robert Halstead, Chris Hanson, Christopher Haynes,
Eugene Kohlbecker, Don Oxley, Kent Pitman, Jonathan Rees, Guillermo
Rozas, Guy L. Steele Jr., Gerald Jay Sussman, and Mitchell Wand. 
</blockquote>

<p class="noindent">and a lot of discussions and debates by the Scheme community.  According
to the following quotation from the original document:

   <blockquote>
We intend this report to belong to the entire Scheme community, and so
we grant permission to copy it in whole or in part without fee.  In
particular, we encourage implementors of Scheme to use this report as a
starting point for manuals and other documentation, modifying it as
necessary. 
</blockquote>

<p class="noindent">the documents are meant to be in the public domain.  They are available

<h5 class="subsubheading">Documentation: Scheme requests for implementation</h5>

<p>The original <acronym>SRFI</acronym> documents are the work of many authors and are
available at:
