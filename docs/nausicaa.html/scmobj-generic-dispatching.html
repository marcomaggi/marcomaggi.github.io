This document describes version 0.2d3 of Nausicaa/Scheme, a set of
Scheme libraries defining a slightly modified R6RS Scheme language
and augmenting the features of the base and standard R6RS libraries.

The project home page of Nausicaa is at:

             `http://marcomaggi.github.com/nausicaa.html'


development of Nausicaa takes place at:

               `http://github.com/marcomaggi/nausicaa/'

<h4 class="subsection">50.7.2 How methods are dispatched</h4>

<p>Here we attempt the formulation of the rules by which methods are
dispatched.  A method is identified by a triplet of values: a list of
classes, called signature, representing the classes or expected
arguments; a boolean value telling if the closure accepts rest
arguments; the closure.

<!--  -->
<h5 class="subsubheading">Applicability</h5>

<p>First we need to understand when a method is applicable to a tuple of
arguments.  Given a tuple of arguments, a method supporting no rest
arguments is applicable to it if:

     <ol type=1 start=1>
<li>The length of the signature is equal to the length of the arguments'
tuple.

     <li>Position by position, the class in the signature is <code>eq?</code> to the
class of the value in the tuple, or it is in the class precedence list
of the class of the value in the tuple.
        </ol>

<p class="noindent">a method supporting rest arguments is applicable to it if:

     <ol type=1 start=1>
<li>The length of the signature is less than or equal to the length of the
arguments' tuple.

     <li>Position by position, up to the last element in the signature, the class
in the signature is <code>eq?</code> to the class of the value in the tuple,
or it is in the class precedence list of the class of the value in the
tuple.
        </ol>

<!--  -->
<h5 class="subsubheading">Specificity</h5>

<p>Now we can understand how to determine which one, among two applicable
methods, is more specific for a tuple of arguments.  Let's call the
methods <var>A</var> and <var>B</var>.  Notice that it is impossible for two
distinct methods, in the same generic function, to have the same
signature and the same support for rest arguments.

     <ol type=1 start=1>
<li>If both <var>A</var> and <var>B</var> support rest arguments: The one with the
longest signature is more specific.

     <li>The classes in the signatures are compared in couples, position by
position from the beginning to the end.

          <ol type=a start=1>
<li>If the classes are <code>eq?</code>, the next couple is inspected.

          <li>If the class from <var>A</var> is a subclass of the one from <var>B</var>: Then
<var>A</var> is more specific than <var>B</var>.  If no subclass relation exists
between the two, the next couple is inspected.

          <li>For the current position, the class of the value in the tuple of
arguments is determined, its class precedence acquired.  The positions
of the classes from the signatures in the class precedence list is
computed: If the class from <var>A</var> comes first, then <var>A</var> is more
specific than <var>B</var>.
          </ol>

     <li>If the methods' signatures have the same length, and, position by
position, the classes of <var>A</var> are <code>eq?</code> to the classes of
<var>B</var>, but <var>A</var> supports rest arguments while <var>B</var> does not:
Then <var>B</var> is more specific than <var>A</var>.
        </ol>
