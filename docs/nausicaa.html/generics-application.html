<h3 class="section">25.2 How generic functions and methods are invoked</h3>

<p>The library <code>(nausicaa language generics)</code> is designed to work
with class definitions from the <code>(nausicaa language classes)</code>
library; these classes are identified by a unique symbol (<acronym>UID</acronym>).

   <p>Ordinary generic functions allow the association of a single method to a
tuple of arguments' classes; when an ordinary generic function is
applied to a tuple of arguments, the following happens:

     <ol type=1 start=1>
<li>For each argument in the tuple a class is determined, then the list of
<acronym>UID</acronym>s representing the class hierarchy is acquired; the tuple of
<acronym>UID</acronym> lists is called <dfn>signature</dfn>.  Each generic function maintains
an internal collection in which every method's closure is associated to
a signature.

     <li>The internal collection of methods is queried for all the methods
applicable to the tuple of arguments, using the signature as search key.

     <li>The list of applicable methods is sorted from the more specific to the
least specific for the signature.  From now on the list of sorted,
applicable methods is handled as a stack.

     <li>The next method is popped from the stack and its closure applied to the
tuple of arguments; the return value of this application becomes the
return value of the generic function application.  If the function calls
its &ldquo;next method&rdquo;: recurse to step 4 (see <a href="generics-next.html#generics-next">Invoking the next method</a>).
        </ol>

   <p>Starred generic functions allow the definition of four kinds of methods:
<code>:primary</code>, <code>:around</code>, <code>:before</code> and <code>:after</code>; we
can think of ordinary generics as starred generics supporing only
<code>:primary</code> methods.  The short description is that <code>:around</code>
methods are applied first, then <code>:before</code>, <code>:primary</code> and
<code>:after</code> methods are applied in this order.  When a
<strong>starred</strong> generic function is applied to a tuple of arguments,
the following happens:

     <ol type=1 start=1>
<li>For each argument in the tuple a class is determined, then the list of
<acronym>UID</acronym>s representing the class hierarchy is acquired; the tuple of
<acronym>UID</acronym> lists is called <dfn>signature</dfn>.  For each kind of method: each
starred generic function maintains an internal collection in which every
method's closure is associated to a signature.

     <li>For each kind of method: the internal collection is queried for all the
methods applicable to the tuple of arguments, using the signature as
search key.

     <li>For each kind of method: the list of applicable methods is sorted from
the more specific to the least specific for the signature.  The list of
<code>:after</code> methods is reversed.
        </ol>

   <p>From now on the lists of sorted applicable methods are handled as
stacks; the stacks of <code>:primary</code>, <code>:around</code> and <code>:before</code>
methods have the most specific method on the top; the stack of
<code>:after</code> methods has the least specific method on the top.

   <p>From now on the application of the generic function enters an implicit
loop in which more methods' closures can be applied to the same tuple of
arguments.  The loop can terminate if a method's closure throws an
exception or, for <code>:around</code> and <code>:primary</code> methods, if it does
not take the special action of calling <code>call-next-method</code>.

   <p>The loop is a bit articulated, so we may have to read the following
descriptions multiple times.  We split the description in two branches:
First a simplified invocation for generic functions having at least one
applicable <code>:primary</code> method, no <code>:around</code> methods, and
performing no calls to <code>call-next-method</code>; then the full
application algorithm.

   <p>Here is the simplified branch with no <code>:around</code> methods and no
calls to <code>call-next-method</code>:

     <ol type=1 start=4>
<li>Pop all the <code>:before</code> methods from the stack and apply their
closures to the tuple of arguments.  The return values of these
applications are discarded.

     <li>Pop the next <code>:primary</code> method from the stack and apply its closure
to the tuple of arguments.  The return value of this application is
saved in a temporary location.

     <li>Pop all the <code>:after</code> methods from the stack and apply their
closures to the tuple of arguments.  The return values of these
applications are discarded.

     <li>Return the saved return value of the <code>:primary</code> method.
        </ol>

<p class="noindent">here is the full application algorithm:

     <ol type=1 start=4>
<li>Test if this function application originated from a call to
<code>call-next-method</code> from a <code>:before</code> or <code>:after</code> method;
if it has: raise an assertion violation.

     <li>Test if this function application originated from a call to
<code>call-next-method</code> from a <code>:primary</code> method; if it has:

          <ol type=a start=1>
<li>If the stack of <code>:primary</code> methods is empty raise an assertion
violation.

          <li>Pop the next <code>:primary</code> method from the stack and apply its closure
to the tuple of arguments.

          <li>Break out returning the return value of this application: it becomes the
return value of <code>call-next-method</code>.
          </ol>

     <li>If the stack of <code>:primary</code> methods is empty: raise an assertion
violation.  This condition means that the generic function has no
applicable methods for the tuple of arguments.

     <li>If the stack of <code>:around</code> methods is not empty: pop the next
<code>:around</code> method and apply its closure to the tuple of arguments. 
Break out returning the return value of this application.

     <li>Pop all the <code>:before</code> methods from the stack and apply their
closures to the tuple of arguments.  The return values of these
applications are discarded.

     <li>Pop the next <code>:primary</code> method from the stack and apply its closure
to the tuple of arguments.  The return value of this application is
saved in a temporary location.

     <li>Pop all the <code>:after</code> methods from the stack and apply their
closures to the tuple of arguments.  The return values of these
applications are discarded.

     <li>Return the saved return value of the <code>:primary</code> method.
        </ol>

   <p>The <code>:primary</code> methods are meant to do the real work of the
function.  Only the most specific is applied to the arguments, however
it can use <code>call-next-method</code> to invoke a least specialised version
and use its return value, and so on recursively until there are no more
next methods.

   <p><code>:before</code> and <code>:after</code> methods are meant to execute additional
work before and after the primary methods; for example test pre and post
conditions on the arguments.  While <code>:before</code> methods are applied
from the most specific to the least specific, <code>:after</code> methods are
applied from the least specific to the most specific.  Notice that the
<code>:after</code> methods have no access to the return value of the
<code>:primary</code> methods.

   <p><code>:around</code> methods are yet another level for performing tasks before
and after the primary methods; only the most specific is applied to the
arguments.  It is expected, but not mandatory, that an <code>:around</code>
method invokes <code>call-next-method</code>; when such invocations are
performed recursively: they will consume all the applicable
<code>:around</code> methods, from the most specific to the least specific,
and then will start the application of <code>:before</code>, <code>:primary</code>
and <code>:after</code> methods.

   <p>The protocol of application for methods in a starred generic function is
meant to be the same as the standard method combination for
<acronym>CLOS</acronym> methods as defined by the Common Lisp
standard<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-1" name="fnd-1"><sup>1</sup></a>.
