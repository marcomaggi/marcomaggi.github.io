This document describes version 0.2d3 of Nausicaa/Scheme, a set of
Scheme libraries defining a slightly modified R6RS Scheme language
and augmenting the features of the base and standard R6RS libraries.

The project home page of Nausicaa is at:

             `http://marcomaggi.github.com/nausicaa.html'


development of Nausicaa takes place at:

               `http://github.com/marcomaggi/nausicaa/'

<h4 class="subsection">2.1.2 Basic types</h4>

<p>Scheme programs manipulate <dfn>objects</dfn>, which are also referred to as
<dfn>values</dfn>.  Scheme objects are organized into sets of values called
<dfn>types</dfn>.  This section gives an overview of the fundamentally
important types of the Scheme language.  More types are described in
later chapters.

   <blockquote>
<strong>NOTE</strong> As Scheme is latently typed, the use of the term
<em>type</em> in this report differs from the use of the term in the
context of other languages, particularly those with manifest typing. 
</blockquote>

<h5 class="subsubheading">Booleans</h5>

<p>A boolean is a truth value, and can be either true or false.  In Scheme,
the object for &ldquo;false&rdquo; is written <code>#f</code>.  The object for &ldquo;true&rdquo;
is written <code>#t</code>.  In most places where a truth value is expected,
however, any object different from <code>#f</code> counts as true.

<h5 class="subsubheading">Numbers</h5>

<p>Scheme supports a rich variety of numerical data types, including
objects representing integers of arbitrary precision, rational numbers,
complex numbers, and inexact numbers of various kinds.  <a href="scheme-numbers.html#scheme-numbers">Numbers</a>

<h5 class="subsubheading">Characters</h5>

<p>Scheme characters mostly correspond to textual characters.  More
precisely, they are isomorphic to the <dfn>scalar values</dfn> of the Unicode
standard.

<h5 class="subsubheading">Strings</h5>

<p>Strings are finite sequences of characters with fixed length and thus
represent arbitrary Unicode texts.

<h5 class="subsubheading">Symbols</h5>

<p>A symbol is an object representing a string, the symbol's <dfn>name</dfn>. 
Unlike strings, two symbols whose names are spelled the same way are
never distinguishable.  Symbols are useful for many applications; for
instance, they may be used the way enumerated values are used in other
languages.

<h5 class="subsubheading">Pairs and lists</h5>

<p>A pair is a data structure with two components.  The most common use of
pairs is to represent (singly linked) lists, where the first component
(the <dfn>car</dfn>) represents the first element of the list, and the second
component (the <dfn>cdr</dfn>) the rest of the list.  Scheme also has a
distinguished empty list, which is the last cdr in a chain of pairs that
form a list.

<h5 class="subsubheading">Vectors</h5>

<p>Vectors, like lists, are linear data structures representing finite
sequences of arbitrary objects.  Whereas the elements of a list are
accessed sequentially through the chain of pairs representing it, the
elements of a vector are addressed by integer indices.  Thus, vectors
are more appropriate than lists for random access to elements.

<h5 class="subsubheading">Procedures</h5>

<p>Procedures are values in Scheme.
