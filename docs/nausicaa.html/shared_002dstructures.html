This document describes version 0.2d14 of Nausicaa/Scheme, a set of
Scheme libraries defining a slightly modified R6RS Scheme language
and augmenting the features of the base and standard R6RS libraries.

The project home page of Nausicaa is at:

development of Nausicaa/Scheme takes place at:

<h2 class="chapter">13 External representation for data with shared structure</h2>

<p><a name="index-g_t_0040library_007bnausicaa-language-shared_002dstructures_007d_002c-library-1329"></a><a name="index-Library-_0040library_007bnausicaa-language-shared_002dstructures_007d-1330"></a>

   <p>The following bindings are exported by the <code>(nausicaa language
shared-structures)</code> library.

   <p><acronym>R6RS</acronym> Scheme provides the procedure <code>write</code>, which prints
machine&ndash;readable representations of lists and other objects.  However,
the printed representation does not preserve information about what
parts of the structure are shared, and in the case of self&ndash;referential
objects the behavior of <code>write</code> itself is undefined; it is
permitted to go into an infinite loop.

   <p>For example, it is possible to have a list within which two or more
members are the same string (in the sense of <code>eq?</code>), but when the
list is written, there is not sufficient information in the
representation to recover the <code>eq?</code> relationship.  When the list is
read back in, there will be two or more copies of the string which are
<code>eqv?</code>  but not <code>eq?</code>.

   <p>As an example of the second problem, the results of evaluating:

<pre class="example">     (define a (cons 'val1 'val2))
     (set-cdr! a a)
     (write a)
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">are undefined.

<div class="defun">

<blockquote><p>Write a written representation of <var>obj</var> to the given <var>port</var>. 
Strings that appear in the written representation are enclosed in
doublequotes, and within those strings backslash and doublequote
characters are escaped by backslashes.  Character objects are written
using the <code>#\</code> notation.

        <p><code>write-with-shared-structure</code> and <code>write/ss</code> are bound to the
same function.

        <p>Objects which denote locations rather than values, if they appear at
more than one point in the data being written, are preceded by
<code>#N=</code> the first time they are written and replaced by <code>#N#</code>
all subsequent times they are written, where <var>N</var> is a natural number
used to identify that particular object.

        <p>If objects which denote locations occur only once in the structure, then
<code>write/ss</code> produces the same external representation for those
objects as <code>write</code>.

        <p><code>write/ss</code> terminates in finite time when writing finite data, and
produces a finite representation when writing finite data.

        <p><code>write/ss</code> returns an unspecified value.

        <p>The <var>port</var> argument may be omitted, in which case it defaults to the
value returned by <code>current-output-port</code>.

        <p>The <var>optarg</var> is ignored.

        <p>The following example shows a cons cell whose cdr contains itself:

     <pre class="example">          (define a (cons 'val1 'val2))
          (set-cdr! a a)
          (write/ss a)
          -| #1=(val1 . #1#)
</pre>

&mdash; Function: <b>read-with-shared-structure</b><var><a name="index-read_002dwith_002dshared_002dstructure-1337"></a></var><br>

<blockquote><p>Convert the external representations of Scheme objects produced by
<code>write/ss</code> into scheme objects.  Return the next object parsable
from the given input <var>port</var>, updating <var>port</var> to point to the
first character past the end of the external representation of the
object.

        <p><code>read-with-shared-structure</code> and <code>read/ss</code> are bound to the
same function.

        <p>If an end&ndash;of&ndash;file is encountered in the input before any characters
are found that can begin an object, then an end&ndash;of&ndash;file object is
returned.  The port remains open, and further attempts to read it (by
<code>read/ss</code> or <code>read</code>) will also return an end&ndash;of&ndash;file object.

        <p>If an end&ndash;of&ndash;file is encountered after the beginning of an object's
external representation, but the external representation is incomplete
and therefore not parsable, an error is signalled.

        <p>The <var>port</var> argument may be omitted, in which case it defaults to the
value returned by <code>current-input-port</code>.

        <p>It is an error to read from a closed port.
