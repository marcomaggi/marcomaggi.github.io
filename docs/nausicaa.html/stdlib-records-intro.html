This document describes version 0.2d14 of Nausicaa/Scheme, a set of
Scheme libraries defining a slightly modified R6RS Scheme language
and augmenting the features of the base and standard R6RS libraries.

The project home page of Nausicaa is at:

             `http://marcomaggi.github.com/nausicaa.html'


development of Nausicaa/Scheme takes place at:

<h4 class="subsection">4.6.1 Introduction</h4>

<p>A record is a compound data structure with a fixed number of components,
called <dfn>fields</dfn>.  Each record has an associated type specified by a
<dfn>record-type descriptor</dfn>, which is an object that specifies the
fields of the record and various other properties that all records of
that type share.  Record objects are created by a <dfn>record
constructor</dfn>, a procedure that creates a fresh record object and
initializes its fields to values.  Records of different types can be
distinguished from each other and from other types of objects by
<dfn>record predicates</dfn>.  A record predicate returns <code>#t</code> when passed
a record of the type specified by the record&ndash;type descriptor and
<code>#f</code> otherwise.  An <dfn>accessor</dfn> extracts from a record the
component associated with a field, and a <dfn>mutator</dfn> changes the
component to a different value.

   <p>Record types can be extended via single inheritance, allowing record
types to model hierarchies that occur in applications like algebraic
data types as well as single&ndash;inheritance class systems.  If a record
type <var>t</var> extends another record type <var>p</var>, each record of type
<var>t</var> is also a record of type <var>p</var>, and the predicate, accessors,
and mutators applicable to a record of type <var>p</var> are also applicable
to a record of type <var>t</var>.  The extension relationship is transitive
in the sense that a type extends its parent's parent, if any, and so on. 
A record type that does not extend another record type is called a
<em>base record type</em>.

   <p>A record type can be <em>sealed</em> to prevent it from being extended. 
Moreover, a record type can be <em>nongenerative</em>, i.e., it is
globally identified by a &ldquo;uid&rdquo;, and new, compatible definitions of a
nongenerative record type with the same uid as a previous always yield
the same record type.

   <p>The record mechanism spans three libraries:

     <dl>
<dt><code>(rnrs records syntactic (6))</code><dd>Library, a syntactic layer for defining a record type and associated
constructor, predicate, accessor, and mutators.

     <br><dt><code>(rnrs records procedural (6))</code><dd>Library, a procedural layer for creating and manipulating record types
and creating constructors, predicates, accessors, and mutators.

     <br><dt><code>(rnrs records inspection (6))</code><dd>Library, a set of inspection procedures. 
</dl>

   <p>The inspection procedures allow programs to obtain from a record
instance a descriptor for the type and from there obtain access to the
fields of the record instance.  This facility allows the creation of
portable printers and inspectors.  A program may prevent access to a
record's type (and thereby protect the information stored in the record
from the inspection mechanism) by declaring the type opaque.  Thus,
opacity as presented here can be used to enforce abstraction barriers.

   <p>Any of the standard types mentioned in this report may or may not be
implemented as an opaque record type.  Thus, it may be possible to use
inspection on objects of the standard types.

   <p>The procedural layer is particularly useful for writing interpreters
that construct host&ndash;compatible record types.  It may also serve as a
target for expansion of the syntactic layers.  The record operations
provided through the procedural layer may, however, be less efficient
than the operations provided through the syntactic layer, which is
designed to allow expand&ndash;time determination of record&ndash;instance sizes
and field offsets.  Therefore, alternative implementations of syntactic
record&ndash;type definition should, when possible, expand into the syntactic
layer rather than the procedural layer.

   <p>The syntactic layer is used more commonly and therefore described first. 
This chapter uses the <var>rtd</var> and <var>constructor-descriptor</var>
parameter names for arguments that must be record&ndash;type descriptors and
constructor descriptors, respectively.
