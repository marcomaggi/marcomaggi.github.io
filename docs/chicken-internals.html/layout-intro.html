<span id="Immediate-and-block-values"></span><h3 class="section">2.1 Immediate and block values</h3>


<p><small>CHICKEN</small> attempts to store data in the most &ldquo;native&rdquo; way it can.  Even though it&rsquo;s written in C,
it tries hard to use machine words everywhere.  So on a 32-bit machine, the native code that&rsquo;s
eventually generated will use 32-bit wide integers and pointers.  On a 64-bit machine it will use
64-bit wide integers and pointers.
</p>
<p>This is known as a &lsquo;<samp>C_word</samp>&rsquo;, which is usually defined as an &lsquo;<samp>int</samp>&rsquo; or a &lsquo;<samp>long</samp>&rsquo;,
depending on the platform.  By the way, the &lsquo;<samp>C_</samp>&rsquo; prefix stands for <small>CHICKEN</small>, not the C
language.  Every Scheme value is represented as a &lsquo;<samp>C_word</samp>&rsquo; internally.  To understand how this
can work, we need to know that there are roughly two kinds of objects.
</p>

<span id="Immediate-values"></span><h4 class="subsubheading">Immediate values</h4>

<p>These are the typical &ldquo;atomic&rdquo; values that come up a lot in computations.  It is important to
represent these as efficiently as possible, so they are packed directly in a &lsquo;<samp>C_word</samp>&rsquo;.  This
includes booleans, the empty list, small integers (these are called fixnums), characters and a few
other special values.
</p>
<p>Because these values are represented directly by a &lsquo;<samp>C_word</samp>&rsquo;, they can be compared in one
instruction: <code>eq?</code> in Scheme.  These values do not need to be heap&ndash;allocated: they fit
directly in a register, and can be passed around &ldquo;by value&rdquo; in C.  This also means they don&rsquo;t need
to be tracked by the garbage collector!
</p>
<p>At a high enough level, these values simply look like this:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">#t #f () 42 #\x
</pre></div>


<span id="Block-objects-1"></span><h4 class="subsubheading">Block objects</h4>

<p>They are values represented pointers to a structure that contains a header and a variable&ndash;length
data block.
</p>
<p>The data block is a pointer which can conceptually be one of two types.  In case of a string or
<acronym>SRFI</acronym>-4 object, the data block is simply an opaque &ldquo;blob&rdquo; or bytevector.  In most other cases,
the block is a compound value consisting of other Scheme objects.  Typical examples are pairs,
vectors and records.
</p>
<p>Because these values are heap&ndash;allocated, two distinct objects are not stored at the same memory
address, even if they store the same value.  That&rsquo;s why comparing their values is a complex
operation.  This operation is either <code>equal?</code> for deep structural comparison, or <code>eqv?</code>
for value comparisons of numbers and symbols.
</p>
<p>The <acronym>R5RS</acronym> specification explains that the difference between <code>eq?</code> and <code>eqv?</code> is not
necessarily the same across Scheme implementations.  For example, in <small>CHICKEN</small>, <code>eq?</code> can be
used to compare characters and fixnums, because they are stored as immediate values.  Portable
programs should not rely on that.  If we use <code>eq?</code> on block objects, their pointers will be
compared: <code>eq?</code> checks whether they are one and the same object.  This can be a useful
operation in its own right.
</p>
<p>Objects represented by data blocks also have to be tracked by the garbage collector: if there are
still references to the block, its data must be copied (recursively) to keep it alive across garbage
collection events.
</p>
<p>Here are some &ldquo;high level&rdquo; examples of block objects:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example"> --------------------------
| pair 2 slots | #\a | #\b |
 --------------------------

 -------------------------------------------
| vector 5 slots | #f | 123 | 456 | #f | 42 |
 -------------------------------------------

 --------------------------    -----------------------
| string 5 bytes | &quot;hello&quot; |  | flonum 8 bytes | 12.5 |
 --------------------------    -----------------------
        ^                           ^
        |                           |
         ---------                   ---------
                  |                           |
 -----------------+-----     -----------------+------
| pair 2 slots |  O | O-|--&gt;| pair 2 slots |  O | () |
 -----------------------     ------------------------
</pre></div>

<p>every block object starts with a header which indicates the type of object and the object&rsquo;s size.
It also determines whether the object&rsquo;s data block is a byte block or a block containing Scheme
objects: if it contains Scheme objects, the header tells us how many slots (locations for storing
Scheme objects) the object has.  Byte blocks, on the other hand, are opaque and can contain any
data.  Their size is stored as a byte count.
</p>
<p>From top to bottom, left to right, these represent the following values:
</p>
<ul>
<li> <code>(#\a . #\b)</code> is a pair containing the character <code>a</code> in its car and <code>b</code> in its cdr.

</li><li> <code>#(#f 123 456 #f 42)</code> is a regular Scheme vector containing fixnums and false values.

</li><li> <code>&quot;hello&quot;</code> is a string consisting of 5 characters (strings are treated as byte vectors in
<small>CHICKEN</small>).

</li><li> <code>12.5</code> is an inexact representation of the number twelve and a half (a &ldquo;flonum&rdquo;).  This is a
byte block storing the raw byte value of a C <code>double</code>.

</li><li> <code>(&quot;hello&quot; . (12.5 . ()))</code> is the first pair of a proper list which contains a string and a
flonum.

</li><li> <code>(12.5 . ())</code> is the cdr of that list; a pair containing a number and the end&ndash;of&ndash;list marker.
</li></ul>

<p>The final two pair objects show that slots (like any <code>C_word</code>) can hold not only immediate
values, but also pointers to block objects.  This leads us to the question: how to differentiate
between a pointer to an object and an immediate object?
