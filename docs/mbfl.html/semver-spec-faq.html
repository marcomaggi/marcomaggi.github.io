<ol class="enumerate">
<li> How should I deal with revisions in the &lsquo;<samp class="samp">0.y.z</samp>&rsquo; initial development phase?

<p>The simplest thing to do is start your initial development release at &lsquo;<samp class="samp">0.1.0</samp>&rsquo; and then
increment the minor version for each subsequent release.
</p>

</li><li> How do I know when to release &lsquo;<samp class="samp">1.0.0</samp>&rsquo;?

<p>If your software is being used in production, it should probably already be &lsquo;<samp class="samp">1.0.0</samp>&rsquo;.  If you
have a stable <abbr class="acronym">API</abbr> on which users have come to depend, you should be &lsquo;<samp class="samp">1.0.0</samp>&rsquo;.  If you&rsquo;re
worrying a lot about backwards compatibility, you should probably already be &lsquo;<samp class="samp">1.0.0</samp>&rsquo;.
</p>

</li><li> Doesn&rsquo;t this discourage rapid development and fast iteration?

<p>Major version zero is all about rapid development.  If you&rsquo;re changing the <abbr class="acronym">API</abbr> every day you
should either still be in version &lsquo;<samp class="samp">0.y.z</samp>&rsquo; or on a separate development branch working on the
next major version.
</p>

</li><li> If even the tiniest backwards incompatible changes to the public <abbr class="acronym">API</abbr> require a major version bump, won&rsquo;t I end up at version &lsquo;<samp class="samp">42.0.0</samp>&rsquo; very rapidly?

<p>This is a question of responsible development and foresight.  Incompatible changes should not be
introduced lightly to software that has a lot of dependent code.  The cost that must be incurred to
upgrade can be significant.  Having to bump major versions to release incompatible changes means
you&rsquo;ll think through the impact of your changes, and evaluate the cost/benefit ratio involved.
</p>

</li><li> Documenting the entire public <abbr class="acronym">API</abbr> is too much work!

<p>It is your responsibility as a professional developer to properly document software that is intended
for use by others.  Managing software complexity is a hugely important part of keeping a project
efficient, and that&rsquo;s hard to do if nobody knows how to use your software, or what methods are safe
to call.  In the long run, <em class="emph">Semantic Versioning</em>, and the insistence on a well defined public
<abbr class="acronym">API</abbr> can keep everyone and everything running smoothly.
</p>

</li><li> What do I do if I accidentally release a backwards incompatible change as a minor version?

<p>As soon as you realize that you&rsquo;ve broken the <em class="emph">Semantic Versioning</em> spec, fix the problem and
release a new minor version that corrects the problem and restores backwards compatibility.  Even
under this circumstance, it is unacceptable to modify versioned releases.  If it&rsquo;s appropriate,
document the offending version and inform your users of the problem so that they are aware of the
offending version.
</p>

</li><li> What should I do if I update my own dependencies without changing the public <abbr class="acronym">API</abbr>?

<p>That would be considered compatible since it does not affect the public <abbr class="acronym">API</abbr>.  Software that
explicitly depends on the same dependencies as your package should have their own dependency
specifications and the author will notice any conflicts.  Determining whether the change is a patch
level or minor level modification depends on whether you updated your dependencies in order to fix a
bug or introduce new functionality.  I would usually expect additional code for the latter instance,
in which case it&rsquo;s obviously a minor level increment.
</p>

</li><li> What if I inadvertently alter the public <abbr class="acronym">API</abbr> in a way that is not compliant with the version number change (i.e. the code incorrectly introduces a major breaking change in a patch release)?

<p>Use your best judgment.  If you have a huge audience that will be drastically impacted by changing
the behavior back to what the public <abbr class="acronym">API</abbr> intended, then it may be best to perform a major version
release, even though the fix could strictly be considered a patch release.  Remember, <em class="emph">Semantic
Versioning</em> is all about conveying meaning by how the version number changes.  If these changes are
important to your users, use the version number to inform them.
</p>

</li><li> How should I handle deprecating functionality?

<p>Deprecating existing functionality is a normal part of software development and is often required to
make forward progress.  When you deprecate part of your public <abbr class="acronym">API</abbr>, you should do two things: (1)
update your documentation to let users know about the change, (2) issue a new minor release with the
deprecation in place.  Before you completely remove the functionality in a new major release there
should be at least one minor release that contains the deprecation so that users can smoothly
transition to the new <abbr class="acronym">API</abbr>.
</p>

</li><li> Does <em class="emph">Semantic Versioning</em> have a size limit on the version string?

<p>No, but use good judgement.  A 255 character version string is probably overkill, for example.
Also, specific systems may impose their own limits on the size of the string.
