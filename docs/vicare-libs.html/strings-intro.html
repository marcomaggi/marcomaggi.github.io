<h3 class="section">20.1 Introduction</h3>

<h5 class="subsubheading">Library organisation</h5>

<p>The functions are split in a high level library, <code>(vicare
containers strings)</code>, and a low level one, <code>(vicare containers
strings low)</code>.  The main difference between the two layers is that the
high level library makes heavy usage of macros to implement the
<dfn>string views</dfn>, which allow accessing substrings using a friendly
syntax.

   <p>All the functions in the low level library are bound to identifiers
starting with <code>%</code>; for example: <code>string-prefix?</code> is a high
level macro, <code>%string-prefix?</code> is its low level function
homologous.

<h5 class="subsubheading">The model for strings</h5>

<p>This library relies on the string representation of the underlying
Scheme implementation: Strings are sequences of &ldquo;code points&rdquo; or
character encodings.  Operations such as comparison or reversal are
always done code point by code point.

   <p>It's possible that a legal string might not be a sensible &ldquo;text&rdquo;
sequence; for example, consider a string comprised entirely of
zero&ndash;width Unicode accent characters with no preceding base character
to modify: It is a legal string, albeit one that does not make sense
when interpreted as a sequence of natural&ndash;language text.  The routines
in <code>(vicare containers strings)</code> do not handle these &ldquo;text&rdquo; concerns.

<h5 class="subsubheading">Direction of iteration</h5>

<p>The library accesses the characters of a string in left&ndash;to&ndash;right or
right&ndash;to&ndash;left order depending on the convenience of the algorithm.

<h5 class="subsubheading">Handling side effects</h5>

<p>Care must be taken when using functions with side effects.  One reason
for this is that some of the supported Scheme implementations will
collapse equal datum strings in the source code to the same string in
the program.  Mutating such a string in a point of the program, will
make the change visible to other points in the program.  For example:

<pre class="example">     (import (rnrs)
       (rnrs mutable-strings))
     
     (define str1 "abcd")
     (define str2 "abcd")
     
     (string-set! str1 2 #\9)
     (write str2)
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">when executed by Ypsilon will print <code>"ab9d"</code>, while when executed
by Mosh will print <code>"abcd"</code> (last verified with revisions checked
out on Fri Jun 5, 2009).  To avoid this problem completely, we can
change the program in this way:

<pre class="example">     (import (rnrs)
       (rnrs mutable-strings))
     
     (define str1 (string-copy "abcd"))
     (define str2 (string-copy "abcd"))
     
     (string-set! str1 2 #\9)
     (write str2)
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">of course we may want to wrap into <code>string-copy</code> only the strings
that are meant to be mutated.
