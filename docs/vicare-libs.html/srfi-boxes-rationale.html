<h4 class="subsection">2.35.2 Rationale</h4>

<p>A box is a container for an object of any Scheme type, including another
box.  It is like a single&ndash;element vector, or half of a pair, or a
direct representation of state.  Boxes are normally used as minimal
mutable storage, and can inject a controlled amount of mutability into
an otherwise immutable data structure (or one that is conventionally
treated as immutable).  They can be used to implement
call&ndash;by&ndash;reference semantics by passing a boxed value to a procedure
and expecting the procedure to mutate the box before returning.

   <p>Some Scheme systems use boxes to implement <code>set!</code>.  In this
transformation, known as <em>assignment conversion</em>, all variables
that are actually mutated are initialized to boxes, and all <code>set!</code>
syntax forms become calls on <code>set-box!</code>.  Naturally, all ordinary
references to those variables must become calls on <code>unbox</code>.  By
reducing all variable mutation to data&ndash;structure mutation in this way,
such Scheme systems are free to maintain variables in multiple hardware
locations, such as the stack and the heap or registers and the stack,
without worrying about exactly when and where they are mutated.

   <p>Boxes are also useful for providing an extra level of indirection,
allowing more than one body of code or data structure to share a
reference, or pointer, to an object.  In this way, if any procedure
mutates the box in any of the data structures, all procedures will
immediately &ldquo;see&rdquo; the new value in all data structures containing it.

   <p>Racket and Chicken provide <em>immutable boxes</em>, which look like boxes
to <code>box?</code> and <code>unbox</code> but which cannot be mutated.  They are
not considered useful enough to be part of this <acronym>SRFI</acronym>.  If they are
provided nevertheless, the recommended constructor name is
<code>immutable-box</code>.

   <p>The features specified in the autoboxing section of specification are
based on those specified by RnRS for promises, which are analogous to
immutable boxes except that their value is specified by code instead of
data.
