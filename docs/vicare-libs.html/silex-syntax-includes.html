<h4 class="subsection">36.5.2 Including macro files</h4>

<p>The special syntax:

<pre class="example">     %[<var>pathname</var>]
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">can be used to include a macro definition file whose pathname is
<var>pathname</var>, which can be any string not including the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">]</span></samp>&rsquo;
character; the <var>pathname</var> is handled as follows:

     <ol type=1 start=1>
<li>If <var>pathname</var> is absolute, test its existence: when found, convert
it to a string representing the real, absolute file pathname.

     <li>If <var>pathname</var> is relative and it has a directory part, test its
existence from the current process working directory: when found,
convert it to a string representing the real, absolute file pathname.

     <li><a name="index-g_t_0040env_007bSILEX_005fPATH_007d_002c-environment-variable-5186"></a><a name="index-Environment-variable-_0040env_007bSILEX_005fPATH_007d-5187"></a>If <var>pathname</var> is relative and it has no directory part, read the
system environment variable <samp><span class="env">SILEX_PATH</span></samp> as colon&ndash;separated list of
directories and search the file in them, from the first to the last:
when found, convert it to a string representing the real, absolute file
pathname.

     <p>Notice that the file is searched in the process' current working
directory only if such directory is listed in the given path.
        </ol>

<p class="noindent">the result of converting <var>?pathname</var> to a real, absolute pathname is
handed as is to <code>open-input-file</code>.  If the file is not found: an
exception is raised.

   <p>Two macros with the same name are allowed if they have the same regexp
specification, this allows an include file to be loaded multiple times. 
Recursive inclusion of files is detected by comparing real, absolute
file pathnames.
