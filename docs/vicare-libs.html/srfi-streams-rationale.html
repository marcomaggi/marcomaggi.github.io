<h4 class="subsection">2.21.3 Rationale</h4>


<a name="index-SRFI-streams-rationale"></a>


<p>Harold Abelson and Gerald Jay Sussman discuss streams at length, giving
a strong justification for their use.  The streams they provide are
represented as a cons pair with a promise to return a stream in its cdr;
for instance, a stream with elements the first three counting numbers is
represented conceptually as:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">(cons 1 (delay (cons 2 (delay (cons 3 (delay '()))))))
</pre></div>

<p>Philip Wadler, Walid Taha and David MacQueen describe such streams as
odd because, regardless of their length, the parity of the number of
constructors (<code>delay</code>, <code>cons</code>, <code>(quote ())</code>) in the
stream is odd.
</p>
<p>The streams provided here differ from those of Abelson and Sussman,
being represented as promises that contain a cons pair with a stream in
its cdr; for instance, the stream with elements the first three counting
numbers is represented conceptually as:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">(delay (cons 1 (delay (cons 2 (delay (cons 3 (delay '())))))))
</pre></div>

<p>this is an even stream because the parity of the number of constructors
in the stream is even.
</p>
<p>Even streams are more complex than odd streams in both definition and
usage, but they offer a strong benefit: they fix the off&ndash;by&ndash;one error
of odd streams.  Wadler, Taha and MacQueen show, for instance, that an
expression like:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">(stream-&gt;list 4 (stream-map / (stream-from 4 -1)))
</pre></div>

<p>evaluates to <code>(1/4 1/3 1/2 1)</code> using even streams but fails with a
divide&ndash;by&ndash;zero error using odd streams, because the next element in
the stream, which will be 1/0, is evaluated before it is accessed.  This
extra bit of laziness is not just an interesting oddity; it is vitally
critical in many circumstances, as will become apparent below.
</p>
<p>When used effectively, the primary benefit of streams is improved
modularity.  Consider a process that takes a sequence of items,
operating on each in turn.  If the operation is complex, it may be
useful to split it into two or more procedures in which the
partially&ndash;processed sequence is an intermediate result.  If that
sequence is stored as a list, the entire intermediate result must reside
in memory all at once; however, if the intermediate result is stored as
a stream, it can be generated piecemeal, using only as much memory as
required by a single item.  This leads to a programming style that uses
many small operators, each operating on the sequence of items as a
whole, similar to a pipeline of unix commands.
</p>
<p>In addition to improved modularity, streams permit a clear exposition of
backtracking algorithms using the &ldquo;stream of successes&rdquo; technique, and
they can be used to model generators and co&ndash;routines.  The implicit
memoization of streams makes them useful for building persistent data
structures, and the laziness of streams permits some multi&ndash;pass
algorithms to be executed in a single pass.  Savvy programmers use
streams to enhance their programs in countless ways.
</p>
<p>There is an obvious space/time trade&ndash;off between lists and streams;
lists take more space, but streams take more time (to see why, look at
all the type conversions in the implementation of the stream
primitives).  Streams are appropriate when the sequence is truly
infinite, when the space savings are needed, or when they offer a
clearer exposition of the algorithms that operate on the sequence.
