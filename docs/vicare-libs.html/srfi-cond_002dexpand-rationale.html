<h4 class="subsection">2.1.3 Rationale</h4>

<p>Most Scheme systems extend the language with some additional features
(such as the ability to manipulate Unicode characters and strings, to do
binary I/O, or to handle asynchronous interrupts).  Such features may be
provided in a variety of ways including new procedures, new program
syntax, and extended behavior of standard procedures and special&ndash;forms.

   <p>A particular functionality may exist in several or even most Scheme
systems but its <acronym>API</acronym> may be different (use of a procedure or
special&ndash;form, name, number of parameters, etc).  To write code that
will run on several Scheme systems, it is useful to have a common
construct to enable or disable sections of code based on the existence
or absence of a feature in the Scheme system being used.  For example,
the construct could be used to check if a particular binary I/O
procedure is present, and if not, load a portable library which
implements that procedure.

   <p>Features are identified by feature identifiers.  In order for the
semantics of this construct to be well&ndash;defined, the feature identifier
must of course refer to a feature which has a well&ndash;defined meaning. 
There is thus a need for a registry, independent of this <acronym>SRFI</acronym>, to
keep track of the formal specification associated with each valid
feature&ndash;identifier.  The <acronym>SRFI</acronym> registry is used for this purpose. 
It is expected that features will eventually be assigned meaningful
names (aliases) by the <acronym>SRFI</acronym> editors to make reading and writing code
less tedious than when using <code>srfi-N</code> feature identifiers.

   <p>Another issue is the binding time of this construct (i.e.  the moment
when it operates).  It is important that the binding time be early so
that a compiler can discard the sections of code that are not needed,
and perform better static analyses.  Expressing this construct through a
procedure returning a boolean, such as:

<pre class="example">     (feature-implemented? 'srfi-5)
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">would not achieve this goal, as its binding time is too late
(i.e. program run&ndash;time).  A read&ndash;time construct, such as Common Lisp's
<code>#+</code> read-macro, is very early but would require non&ndash;trivial
changes to the reader of existing Scheme systems and the syntax is not
particularly human friendly.  Instead, a macro&ndash;expansion&ndash;time
construct is used.

   <p>The construct is restricted to the top level of a program in order to
simplify its implementation and to force a more disciplined use of the
construct (to facilitate reading and understanding programs) and to
avoid (some) misunderstandings related to the scope of features.  These
restrictions can of course be lifted by some Scheme systems or by other
<acronym>SRFI</acronym>s (in particular module system <acronym>SRFI</acronym>s).
