<h4 class="subsection">2.30.3 Rationale</h4>


<p>The mechanism defined in this <acronym>SRFI</acronym> should be available in every
Scheme system because it has already proven useful for interactive
development&mdash;-of <acronym>SRFI</acronym>s.
</p>
<p>Although it is extremely straightforward, the origin of the particular
mechanism described here is the <samp>examples.scm</samp> file accompanying
the reference implementation of <acronym>SRFI</acronym>-42.  The same mechanism has
been reimplemented for the reference implementation of <acronym>SRFI</acronym>-67, and
a simplified version is yet again found in the reference implementation
of <acronym>SRFI</acronym>-77.
</p>
<p>The mechanism in this <acronym>SRFI</acronym> does not replace more sophisticated
approaches to unit testing, like <acronym>SRFI</acronym>-64 or SchemeUnit.  These
systems provide more control of the testing, separate the definition of
a test, its execution, and its reports, and provide several other
features.
</p>
<p>Neil Van Dyke&rsquo;s Testeez library is very close in spirit to this
<acronym>SRFI</acronym>.  In Testeez, tests are disabled by (re&ndash;)defining a macro.
The advantage of this method is that the code for the test cases can be
removed entirely, and hence even the dependency on the Testeez library.
This <acronym>SRFI</acronym> on the other hand, uses a Scheme conditional <code>(cond,
if)</code> to prevent execution of the testing code.  This method is more
dynamic but retains dead testing code, unless a compiler and a module
system are used to apply constant folding and dead code elimination.
The only major addition in <acronym>SRFI</acronym> over Testeez is the comprehension
for formulating parametric tests.
</p>
<p>Design considerations for this <acronym>SRFI</acronym> include the following:
</p>
<ul>
<li> Reporting is human&ndash;readable and as specific as possible, i.e. not just
&ldquo;assertion failed&rdquo; but the expression with actual and expected value,
and if possibly the relevant part of the bindings environment.

</li><li> An effort is made to print closed Scheme expressions, i.e. expressions
that can directly be copy/pasted into a <acronym>REPL</acronym> for further analysis
(e.g. the let expression in the abstract).

</li><li> By default the checks report both correct and failed checks.  However,
it is possible to reduce the output, or even to switch off the execution
of checks.  It has turned out useful to be able to run only some subset
checks for the features currently under development.  This can be done
by changing the reporting mode between differnt sections.

</li><li> The global state (correct/failed count) is not made available to the
user program.  This reduces the dependencies between different checks
because it is not possible to use the state.

</li><li> Ocassionally, it is useful to check that a certain expression does not
yield an ordinary result but raises an error.  However, <acronym>R5RS</acronym> does
not specify the mechanism by which this occurs (e.g. raising exception,
breaking into a <acronym>REPL</acronym>, aborting the program, etc.).  For this reason,
this <acronym>SRFI</acronym> is restricted to the case that the checked expressions
evaluate normally.

</li><li> Though usually I am very much in favor of strictly prefix syntax, for
this <acronym>SRFI</acronym> I make an exception because the infix <code>=&gt;</code> syntax is
widely used and intuitive.
</li></ul>
