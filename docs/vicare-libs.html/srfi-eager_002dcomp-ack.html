<h4 class="subsection">2.22.6 Related work and acknowledgements</h4>

<p>Several other proposals related to the mechanism specified here exists. 
The following mechanisms are made for and in Scheme (or at least a
specific dialect thereof).

   <p>First of all, the report <acronym>R5RS</acronym> of Scheme itself defines two
constructs for writing loops: <code>do</code> and named <code>let</code>.  Both
constructs express a single loop (not nested), possibly with several
variables running in parallel, based on explicit manipulation of the
state variables.  For example:

<pre class="example">     (do ([x 0 (+ x 1)])
         ([= x 10])
       (display x))
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">explicitly mentions how to obtain the next binding of <var>x</var>.

   <p>Richard Kelsey's &ldquo;Macros for writing loops&rdquo;, are an extension to
Scheme48 to simplify the formulation of loops.  The basic idea is to
stick with a <code>do</code>&ndash;like syntax for more sophisticated loop
constructs, not necessarily manipulating a state variable explicitly. 
For example:

<pre class="example">     (list* x '(1 2 3))
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">expresses an enumeration of the variable <var>x</var> through the list
<code>(1 2 3)</code> without explicit state manipulation.  The iteration
constructs of MWL, <code>named</code> <code>iterate</code> and <code>reduce</code>,
express a single (not nested) loop (<code>iterate</code>) or comprehension
(<code>reduce</code>) with any number of parallel enumerations.

   <p>A most important feature of the MWL&ndash;concept is a modular way to add
sequence types (generators).  In effect, the addition of a new sequence
type does not require a modification of the existing macros.  This is
achieved by carefully limiting the expressive power of the loop
constructs and by using the macros in Continuation Passing Style to call
other macros.  The MWL&ndash;concept, and its implementation, were most
influential for this <acronym>SRFI</acronym>.

   <p>Another related mechanism is the library of streams recently submitted
by Phil L. Bewig as <acronym>SRFI</acronym>-40 (superseded by <acronym>SRFI</acronym>-41).  The
library contains a data type to represent even streams (both car and cdr
potentially delayed) and defines procedures for manipulating these
streams.  Moreover, the macro <code>stream-of</code> defines a lazy
comprehension resulting in the stream of values of an expression subject
to generators and filters.

   <p>A fixed set of generators (lists, vector, string, port, and naturally:
streams) is supported; extending the list of generators requires
changing <code>stream-of</code>.  Nevertheless, modularity is high since it is
easy to define a procedure producing a stream object and this can be
used for enumeration.  The order of enumeration is left unspecified to
allow interleaving of generators (also refer to above).

   <p>Before Phil submitted his <acronym>SRFI</acronym>s, we had a short discussion in which
we clarified the semantic and syntactic differences of our approaches. 
It turned out that the mechanisms are sufficiently different not to
unify them.  The most important difference is the design rationale: Phil
created his library to support the stream paradigm in Scheme, inspired
by the work done for Haskell and other lazy languages, and intrigued by
the beauty of programming with infinite streams.  My work only aims at a
convenient way of expressing frequent patterns of loops in a compact
way.  For what it is worth, section <acronym>SRFI</acronym>-40-ec contains a suggestion
for extending the eager comprehension mechanism for <acronym>SRFI</acronym>-41 streams.

   <p>Phil's work on streams and lazy comprehensions in Scheme triggered Eli
Barzilay to implement a library of eager comprehensions for
<acronym>PLT</acronym>&ndash;Scheme.  The mechanism implemented by Eli is in essence
very similar to the one proposed in this <acronym>SRFI</acronym>, and the two efforts
have been independent until recently.  Syntactically, Eli uses infix
operators for generators, whereas this <acronym>SRFI</acronym> is purely prefix, and Eli
uses the:

<pre class="example">     [<var>expr</var> | <var>outer</var> .. <var>inner</var>]
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">convention for nesting, whereas this <acronym>SRFI</acronym> uses the:

<pre class="example">     [outer .. inner | expr]
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">convention.  Semantically, Eli's mechanism defines more flexible loops
than this <acronym>SRFI</acronym>.  Comprehensions are regarded as generalized
collection processes like <code>fold</code> and <code>reduce</code>.  The mechanism
in this <acronym>SRFI</acronym> is more restricted with respect to control flow (there
is no general <code>while</code>) and more extensive with respect to
generators and comprehensions.  Despite the strong conceptual
similarity, the design rationales are different.  This <acronym>SRFI</acronym> focuses
on portability and modular extension, whatever that may cost in terms of
expressive power.

   <p>Finally, I would like to thank Mike Sperber for his encouragement to
proceed with the <acronym>SRFI</acronym> and for several discussions of the matter.  In
particular, the dispatching mechanism evolved rapidly during discussions
with Mike.
