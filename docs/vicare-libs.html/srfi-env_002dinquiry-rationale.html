<h4 class="subsection">2.36.2 Rationale</h4>

<p>The feature symbols of the <acronym>R7RS</acronym>&ndash;small <code>cond-expand</code> syntax
provide the ability to conditionally compile code based on particular
properties of an implementation that it sees fit to publish.  The
<code>features</code> procedure, which returns the list of feature symbols of
the implementation, provides run&ndash;time access to the same set of
properties.  Assuming that Rhinoceros Scheme provides the feature symbol
<code>rhinoceros</code> but not <code>diplodocus</code> and Diplodocus Scheme does
the opposite, programs can portably ask &ldquo;Is this Rhinoceros Scheme or
Diplodocus Scheme?&rdquo; and behave differently at run time based on the
answer.  Similarly, a program can ask &ldquo;Does this implementation have
exact complex numbers?&rdquo; by checking for the presence of the
<code>exact-complex</code> feature symbol in the result of calling
<code>features</code>.

   <p>However, a program using just the <code>features</code> procedure cannot
report to its user &ldquo;I am executing on X Scheme&rdquo; for every value of X,
because it does not know which symbol in the feature list represents the
implementation name, nor does it have a comprehensive list of
implementation names.  Similarly, there are other properties that the
feature list may allow testing for but not reporting on, such as the
underlying <acronym>OS</acronym> and the <acronym>CPU</acronym> architecture.  For the sake of
logging and debugging, it is necessary or at least extremely useful to
provide a standard way for Scheme applications, as well as Scheme users
at the <acronym>REPL</acronym>, to report these things.  In the Common Lisp world, bugs
are often reported in a <acronym>REPL</acronym> transcript beginning with a call to
<code>lisp-implementation-version</code>.
