<h4 class="subsection">1.21.1 Introduction</h4>

<p>The <code>(vicare language-extensions comparisons)</code> library defines a
mechanism for comparing Scheme values with respect to a total order (aka
linear order).  The mechanism provides operations for:

     <ol type=1 start=1>
<li>Comparing objects of the built-in types.

     <li>Using a total order in situations that arise in programs.

     <li>Facilitating the definition of a new total order.
        </ol>

   <p>Traditionally, a total order is represented in Scheme by an order
predicate, like <code>&lt;</code> or <code>char&lt;?</code>.  In the context of
<code>(vicare language-extensions comparisons)</code>, however, a total order
is represented by a Scheme procedure comparing its two arguments and
returning either -1, 0, or 1 depending on whether
the first argument is considered smaller, equal, or greater than the
second argument respectively.  Examples of such compare procedures
include:

<pre class="example">     (lambda (x y)
       (sign (- x y)))
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">for comparing real numbers, but also:

<pre class="example">     (lambda (x y) 0)
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">comparing anything.

   <p>The primary reason for using 3&ndash;valued compare procedures
(instead of 2&ndash;valued order predicates) is efficiency: When
comparison is computationally expensive, it is wasteful if two
predicates are evaluated where a single 3&ndash;valued comparison
would suffice.

   <p>But dealing directly with 3&ndash;valued comparisons in the
application program is inconvenient and obscures intention: For testing
x &lt; y one would have to write:

<pre class="example">     (= (compare x y) -1)
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">for this reason, an operation <code>&lt;?</code> is supplied which allows to
phrase the same test as:

<pre class="example">     (&lt;? compare x y)
</pre>
   <p>This is an example of mapping the three possible outcomes of a
comparison into the two boolean values <code>#t</code> and <code>#f</code>.  Since
<code>&lt;?</code>  takes the total order as an explicit parameter, a comfortably
large arsenal of tests can be made available for each and every total
order.  This deviates from the approach of <acronym>R6RS</acronym>, in which there are
only five operations (<code>=</code>, <code>&lt;</code>, <code>&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;=</code>,
<code>&gt;=</code>) and for each total order (real/number, char, char&ndash;ci,
string, string&ndash;ci) a complete set of these five operations is provided.

   <p>But still, using <code>&lt;?</code> would be inconvenient if the compare
procedure would have to be supplied explicitly every time.  For this
reason, the argument <var>compare</var> is often made optional and the
procedure <code>default-compare</code> is used whenever no <var>compare</var>
procedure is passed explicitly.  <code>default-compare</code> defines some
resonable total order on the builtin types of <acronym>R6RS</acronym>.

   <p>For the definition of comparison procedures, special control structures
(macros) are provided.  These control structures can be used in the
definition of a (potentially recursive) comparison procedure.
