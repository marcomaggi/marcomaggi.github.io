<h4 class="subsection">4.29.1 Introduction to <acronym>PID</acronym> files</h4>

<p>A lock <acronym>PID</acronym> file is a textual file in <acronym>ASCII</acronym> encoding created
at process start time and deleted at process exit time; it contains a
string representing the <acronym>PID</acronym> number of the current process
followed by a newline character.

   <p>The lock <acronym>PID</acronym> file is especially useful whenever a server is
executed as daemon:

     <ul>
<li>It allows the execution of a single instance of the daemon, causing
instances launched later to recognise themselves as such and so exit.

     <li>It allows for quick retrieval of the <acronym>PID</acronym> number, which can be
used to send interprocess signals to the daemon; for example: to shut it
down, to restart it, to update its configuration. 
</ul>

   <p>The lock <acronym>PID</acronym> file must be created after a server daemonisation
process has completed: this way we correctly store the <acronym>PID</acronym> of
the daemon process, rather than the <acronym>PID</acronym> of the starting
process.

   <p>The lock <acronym>PID</acronym> file must be created after a process has changed
its user and group IDs to drop special privileges: this way the file is
created with appropriate owner and group.

   <p>All the operations performed by this library are logged; logging
operations related to the lock <acronym>PID</acronym> file rely on a function
handed as argument.
