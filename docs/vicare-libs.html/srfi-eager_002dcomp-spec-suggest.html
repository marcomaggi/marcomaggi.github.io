<h5 class="subsubsection">2.22.4.4 Suggestions for application specific extensions</h5>

<h5 class="subsubheading">Arrays in the sense of <acronym>SRFI</acronym>-25</h5>

<p>In order to create an array from a sequence of elements, a comprehension
with the following syntax would be useful:

<pre class="example">     (array-ec <var>shape</var> <var>qualifier</var>* <var>expression</var>)
</pre>
   <p>The comprehension constructs a new array of the given shape by filling
it row&ndash;major with the sequence of elements as specified by the
qualifiers.  On the generator side, it would be most useful to have a
generator of the form:

<pre class="example">     (:array <var>vars</var> <var>arg</var>)
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">running through the elements of the array in row&ndash;major.  For the
optional index variable, the extension <code>(index </code><var>k1</var> <var>k</var><code>*)</code>
could be defined where <var>k1</var> <var>k</var><code>*</code> are variable names
indexing the various dimensions.

<!--  -->
<h5 class="subsubheading">Random Numbers in the sense of <acronym>SRFI</acronym>-27</h5>

<p>In order to create a vector or list of random numbers, it would be
convenient to have generators of the following form:

<pre class="example">     (:random-integer [ <var>range</var> [ <var>number</var> ] ] )
     (:random-real    [ <var>number</var> ] )
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">where <var>range</var> (default 2) indicates the range of the integers and
<var>number</var> (default infinity) specifies how many elements are to be
generated.  Derived from these basic generators, one could define
several other generators for other distributions (e.g. Gaussian).

<!--  -->
<h5 class="subsubheading">Bitstrings in the sense of <acronym>SRFI</acronym>-33</h5>

<p>As eager comprehensions are efficient, they can be useful for operations
involving strings of bits.  It could be useful to have the following
comprehension:

<pre class="example">     (bitwise-ec <var>qualifier</var>* <var>expression</var>)
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">which constructs an integer from bits obtained as values of
<var>expression</var> in the ordering defined by <acronym>SRFI</acronym>-33.  In other words,
if the sequence of values is <var>x</var><code>[0]</code>, <var>x</var><code>[1]</code>,
<small class="dots">...</small>, <var>x</var><code>[n-1]</code> then the result is:

<pre class="example">     x[0] + x[1] 2 + ... + x[n-1] 2^(n-1)
</pre>
   <p>On the generator side, a generator of the form:

<pre class="example">     (:bitwise <var>vars</var> <var>arg1</var> <var>arg</var>*)
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">runs through the sequence of bits obtained by appending the binary
digits of the integers <var>arg1</var> <var>arg</var>*.

<!--  -->
<h5 class="subsubheading">Streams in the sense of <acronym>SRFI</acronym>-41</h5>

<p>It is possible to &ldquo;lazify&rdquo; the eager comprehension <code>list-ec</code>,
constructing a stream in the sense of <acronym>SRFI</acronym>-41.  Clearly, such a
comprehension (<code>stream-ec</code>) is not eager at all since it only runs
the loops when results are requested.  It is also possible to define a
<code>:stream</code> generator with the same <acronym>API</acronym> as <code>:list</code> but
running through streams instead of lists.

   <p>For what is worth, the file <samp><span class="file">srfi40-ec.scm</span></samp> implements
<code>:stream</code> and <code>stream-ec</code> and gives an example.  The
implementation makes substantial use of
<code>call-with-current-continuation</code> to run the loop only when
necessary.  In some implementations of Scheme this may involve
considerable overhead.

<!--  -->
<h5 class="subsubheading">Reading Text Files</h5>

<p>Eager comprehensions can also be used to process files.  However, bear
in mind that an eager comprehension wants to read and process the entire
file right away.  Nevertheless, these generators would be useful for
reading through the lines of a file or through the characters of a file:

<pre class="example">     (:lines-of-file <var>vars</var> <var>file</var>)
     (:chars-of-file <var>vars</var> [ (line <var>variable1</var>) ] [ (column <var>variable2</var>) ] <var>file</var>)
</pre>
   <p>Here <var>file</var> is either an input port or a string interpreted as a
filename.  In a similar fashion, generators reading from sockets defined
by <acronym>URL</acronym>s or other communication facilities could be defined.

<!--  -->
<h5 class="subsubheading">The Scheme shell Scsh</h5>

<p>In the Scheme&ndash;shell, Scsh, it could be useful to have certain
comprehensions and generators.  Candidates for comprehensions are
<code>begin-ec</code>, <code>|-ec</code>, <code>||-ec</code>, and <code>&amp;&amp;-ec</code>.

   <p>Concerning generators, it might be useful to have <code>:directory</code>
running through the records of a directory, and maybe a sophisticated
<code>:file-match-generator</code> could enumerate file record in a directory
structure.  Optional variables of the generators could give convenient
access frequent components of the file records (e.g. the filename). 
Another candidate is <code>:env</code> to run through the environment
associations.  It is left to other authors and other <acronym>SRFI</acronym>s to define
a useful set of comprehensions and generators for Scsh.
