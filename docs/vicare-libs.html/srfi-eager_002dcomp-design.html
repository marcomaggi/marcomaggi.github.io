<h4 class="subsection">2.22.5 Design rationale</h4>


<a name="What-is-the-difference-between-eager-and-lazy-comprehensions_003f"></a>
<h4 class="subsubheading">What is the difference between eager and lazy comprehensions?</h4>

<p>A lazy comprehension, for example <code>stream-of</code> in the sense of
<acronym>SRFI</acronym>-41, constructs an object representing a sequence of values.  They
are actually produced only at the time they are needed.  An eager
comprehension, on the other hand, is an instruction to run through a
certain sequence of values and do something with it, for example as in
<code>do-ec</code>.  In other words, it is nothing more sophisticated than a
loop, potentially with a more convenient notation.  This also explains
why <code>stream-of</code> is the most fundamental lazy comprehension, and all
others can be formulated in terms of it, whereas the most fundamental
eager comprehension is <code>do-ec</code>.
</p>

<a name="Why-the-_005bouter-_002e_002e-inner-_007c-expr_005d-order-of-qualifiers_003f"></a>
<h4 class="subsubheading">Why the <code>[<var>outer</var> .. <var>inner</var> | <var>expr</var>]</code> order of qualifiers?</h4>

<p>In principle, there are six possible orders in which the qualifiers and
the expression of a comprehension can be written.  We denote the
different conventions with a pattern in which <var>expr</var> denotes the
expression over which the comprehension ranges, <var>inner</var> denotes the
generator spinning fastest, and <var>outer</var> denotes the generator
spinning slowest.  For example, Haskell and Python use:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">[<var>expr</var> | <var>outer</var> .. <var>inner</var>]
</pre></div>

<p>Probably with sufficient persistence, instances for any of the
conventions can be found on the Internet.  In addition, there is the
common mathematical notation <code>{f(x) | x in X}</code>.
</p>
<p>It is important to understand that the notational convention does not
only determine the order of enumeration but also the scope of the
variables introduced by the generators.  The scope of <var>inner</var>
includes <var>expr</var>, and the scope of <var>outer</var> should include
<var>inner</var> to allow <var>inner</var> generators to depend on <var>outer</var>
generators.  Eventually, the choice for a particular syntactic
convention is largely a matter of personal preferences.  However, there
are a few considerations that went into the choice made for this
<acronym>SRFI</acronym>:
</p>
<ol>
<li> The mathematical notation is universally known and widely used.
However, the mathematical notation denotes a set of comprehensions in
which the order of the qualifiers is either irrelevant or must be
deduced from the context.  For the purpose of eager comprehensions as a
programming language construct, the order does matter and a simple
convention is a plus.  For these reasons, the mathematical notation as
such is undesirable, but its widespread use is in favor of:

<div class="example">
<pre class="example">[<var>expr</var> | <var>inner</var> .. <var>outer</var>]
</pre></div>

<p>and:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">[<var>expr</var> | <var>outer</var> .. <var>inner</var>]
</pre></div>

</li><li> It is desirable to have the scope of the variables increase into one
direction, as in:

<div class="example">
<pre class="example">[<var>expr</var> | <var>inner</var> .. <var>outer</var>]
</pre></div>

<p>and:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">[<var>outer</var> .. <var>inner</var> | <var>expr</var>]
</pre></div>

<p>and not change direction, as in:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">[<var>expr</var> | <var>outer</var> .. <var>inner</var>]
</pre></div>

<p>where <var>expr</var> is in the scope of <var>inner</var> but <var>outer</var> is not.
This is even more important if the syntax in Scheme does not explicitly
contain the <code>|</code> separator.
</p>
</li><li> More complicated comprehensions with several nested generators
eventually look like nested loops and Scheme always introduces them
<var>outer</var> &hellip; <var>inner</var> as in <code>do</code> and named <code>let</code>.
This is in favor of:

<div class="example">
<pre class="example">[<var>expr</var> | <var>outer</var> .. <var>inner</var>]
</pre></div>

<p>and:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">[<var>outer</var> .. <var>inner</var> | <var>expr</var>]
</pre></div>

<p>Shorter comprehensions may look more naturally the other way around.
</p></li></ol>

<p>Regarding these contradicting preferences, I regard linearity in scoping
(point 2) most important, followed by readability for more complicated
comprehensions (point 3).  This leads to:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">[<var>outer</var> .. <var>inner</var> | <var>expr</var>]
</pre></div>

<p>An example in Scheme syntax is:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">(list-ec (: x 10) (: y x) (f x y))
</pre></div>

<p>which looks acceptable to me even without similarity to the mathematical
notation.  As a downside, the convention clashes with other the
convention used in other languages (e.g. Haskell and Python).
</p>

<a name="You-forgot-choose-your-favorite-here_002d_002dec_0021"></a>
<h4 class="subsubheading">You forgot <em>choose your favorite here</em>&ndash;<code>ec!</code></h4>

<p>I tried to construct a reasonably useful set of tools according to what
<acronym>R5RS</acronym> specifies.  Nevertheless, the choice about what to include and
what to leave out is a matter of personal preference.
</p>
<p>When &ldquo;packing the toolbox&rdquo; I went for travelling light; this <acronym>SRFI</acronym>
does not include everything imaginable or even everything useful.  I
oriented myself at the standard procedures of <acronym>R5RS</acronym>, with a few
omissions and additions.  A notable omission are <code>gcd-ec</code> and
<code>lcm-ec</code> because they are one&ndash;liners, and more severely, of
questionable value in practice.  Notable additions are <code>fold-ec</code>
and <code>fold3-ec</code>, providing a mechanism to define lots of useful
one&ndash;liners.  The other notable addition is <code>first-ec</code>, which is
the fundamental &ldquo;early stopping&rdquo; comprehension.  It is used to define
<code>any?-ec</code> and <code>every?-ec</code> which are among the most frequent
comprehensions.
</p>
<p>Concerning the generators, the same principle has been used.  Additions
include <code>:range</code> and friends because they are universally needed,
and <code>:dispatched</code> which is primarily intended for implementing
<code>:</code>.
</p>

<a name="Why-is-the-order-of-enumeration-specified_003f"></a>
<h4 class="subsubheading">Why is the order of enumeration specified?</h4>

<p>For the purpose of this <acronym>SRFI</acronym>, every generator runs through its
sequence of bindings in a well specified order, and nested generators
run through the Cartesian product in the order of nested loops.  The
purpose of this definition is making the sequence as easily predictable
as possible.  On the other hand, many mechanisms for lazy comprehensions
do not specify the order in which the elements are enumerated.  When it
comes to infinite streams, this has the great advantage that a
comprehension may interleave an inner and an outer enumeration, a method
also known as &ldquo;dove&ndash;tailing&rdquo; or &ldquo;diagonalizing&rdquo;.  Interleaving
ensures that any value of the resulting stream is produced after a
finite amount of time, even if one or more inner streams are infinite.
</p>

<a name="Why-both-typed-and-dispatching-generators_003f"></a>
<h4 class="subsubheading">Why both typed and dispatching generators?</h4>

<p>The reason for typed generators is runtime efficiency.  In fact, the
code produced by <code>:range</code> and others will run as fast as a
hand&ndash;coded <code>do</code> loop.  The primary purpose of the dispatching
generator is convenience.  It comes at the price of reduced runtime
performance, both for loop iteration and startup.
</p>

<a name="Why-the-something_002dec-and-_003atype-naming_003f"></a>
<h4 class="subsubheading">Why the <code>something-ec</code> and <code>:type</code> naming?</h4>

<p>The purpose of the <code>:type</code> convention is to keep many common
comprehensions down to one&ndash;liners.  In my opinion, the fundamental
nature of eager comprehensions justifies a single character naming
convention.  The <code>something-ec</code> convention is primarily intended to
stay away from the widely used <code>something-of</code>.  It reduces
confusion and conflict with related mechanisms.
</p>

<a name="Why-combine-variable-binding-and-sequence-definition_003f"></a>
<h4 class="subsubheading">Why combine variable binding and sequence definition?</h4>

<p>The generators of this <acronym>SRFI</acronym> do two different things with a single
syntactic construct: They define a sequence of values to enumerate and
they specify a variable (within a certain scope) to run through that
sequence.  An alternative is to separate the two, for example as it has
been done in <acronym>SRFI</acronym>-41.
</p>
<p>The reason for combining sequence definition and enumeration for the
purpose of this <acronym>SRFI</acronym> is threefold.  Firstly, sequences of values are
not explicitly represented as objects in the typed generators; the
generators merely manipulate an internal state.  Secondly, this <acronym>SRFI</acronym>
aims at a most concise notation for common comprehensions and reduces
syntax to the naked minimum.  Thirdly, this <acronym>SRFI</acronym> aims at the highest
possible performance for typed generators, which is achieved if the
state being manipulated is represented by the loop variable itself.
</p>

<a name="Why-is-_0028_003a-vars_0029-illegal_003f"></a>
<h4 class="subsubheading">Why is <code>(: <var>vars</var>)</code> illegal?</h4>

<p>It is reasonable and easy to define:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">(: <var>vars</var>)
</pre></div>

<p>as:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">(:integers <var>vars</var>)
</pre></div>

<p>enumerating the non&ndash;negative integers.  However, it turned out that a
frequent mistake in using the eager comprehensions is to forget either
the variable or an argument for the enumeration.  As this would lead to
an infinite loop (not always equally pleasant in interactive sessions),
it is not allowed.
</p>

<a name="Why-is-there-no-_003asequential_003f"></a>
<h4 class="subsubheading">Why is there no <code>:sequential</code>?</h4>

<p>Just like <code>:parallel</code> enumerates generators in parallel, a
<code>:sequential</code> generator could enumerate a concatenation of several
generator, starting the next one when the previous has finished.  The
reason for not having such a qualifier is that the generators should use
all the same variable name and there is no hygienic and referentially
transparent way of enforcing this (or even knowing the variable).
</p>

<a name="Why-is-there-no-general-let-qualifier_003f"></a>
<h4 class="subsubheading">Why is there no general <code>let</code> qualifier?</h4>

<p>It is easy to add <code>let</code>, <code>let*</code>, and <code>letrec</code> as cases to
<var>qualifier</var>.  This would allow more sophisticated local variables
and expressions than possible with:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">(:let <var>vars</var> <var>expression</var>)
</pre></div>

<p>and:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">(begin <var>sequence</var>*)
</pre></div>

<p>In particular, a local <var>definition</var> in the sense of <acronym>R5RS</acronym> Section
7.1.5 would be possible.
</p>
<p>There are two reasons for not including <code>let</code> and friends as
qualifiers.  The first reason concerns readability.  A qualifier of the
form:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">(let (<var>binding-spec</var>*) <var>body</var>)
</pre></div>

<p>only makes sense if the scope of the new variables ends at the end of
the comprehension, and not already after <var>body</var>.  The similarity
with ordinary <code>let</code> expressions would be very confusing.  The
second reason concerns the design rationale.  If sophisticated
<code>let</code> qualifiers involving recursion or local definitions are
needed, it is likely that eager comprehensions are being overused.  In
that case it might be better to define a procedure for the task.  So
including an invitation to overuse the mechanism would be a serious
violation of the Keep It Simple and Stupid principle.
</p>

<a name="Why-is-there-no-_003anested-generator_003f"></a>
<h4 class="subsubheading">Why is there no <code>:nested</code> generator?</h4>

<p>The specification above defines nested as a qualifier but
<code>:parallel</code> as a generator.  In particular, this makes it
impossible to make parallel generators from nested ones.
</p>
<p>This design simply reflects an implementability limitation.  All
component generators of <code>:parallel</code> are transformed into
<code>:do-generators</code> and these can be merged into a parallel generator.
However, nested generators cannot be merged easily without losing the
type of the generator, which would seriously hurt modularity and
performance.
</p>

<a name="Is-any_003f_002dec-eager_003f"></a>
<h4 class="subsubheading">Is <code>any?-ec</code> eager?</h4>

<p>Yes, it is still eager because it immediately starts to run through the
sequence.
</p>
<p>In fact, the reference implementation makes sure <code>first-ec</code>,
<code>any?-ec</code>, and <code>every?-ec</code> execute efficiently so they can be
used conveniently as in:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">(every?-ec (:list x my-list) (pred? x))
</pre></div>


<a name="Why-this-whole-_003adispatched-business_003f"></a>
<h4 class="subsubheading">Why this whole <code>:dispatched</code> business?</h4>

<p>It is specified above that the dispatching generator, called <code>:</code>,
is just a special case of <code>:dispatched</code> using a global dispatching
procedure.  Alternatively, a simple fixed global mechanism to extend
<code>:</code> could have been used.  This is much simpler but does not
support the definition of new dispatched generators.
</p>
<p>The purpose of <code>:dispatched</code> and its utilities
(<code>:generator-proc</code> and <code>dispatch-union</code>) is the following.
Assume <code>:</code> is to be used inside a module but it is essential that
no other module can spoil it, e.g. by installing a very slow dispatcher.
The recommended way to proceed in this case is to define a local copy of
the original dispatching generator <code>:</code>, for example with the
following code:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">(define :my-dispatch
  (make-initial-:-dispatch))

(define-syntax :my
  (syntax-rules (index)
    [(:my cc var (index i) arg1 arg ...)
     (:dispatched cc var (index i) :my-dispatch arg1 arg ...)]
    [(:my cc var arg1 arg ...)
     (:dispatched cc var :my-dispatch arg1 arg ...)]))
</pre></div>

<p>and to use the new generator <code>:my</code> instead of <code>:</code>.
</p>
<p>An alternative for the dispatching mechanism as defined in this <acronym>SRFI</acronym>
is the use of parameter objects in the sense of <acronym>SRFI</acronym>-39.  The
dispatching generator would then access a dynamically scoped variable to
find the dispatcher, allowing full control over dispatching.  However,
this approach does not solve the dilemma that it is sometimes useful
that <code>:</code> is global and sometimes undesired.  The approach specified
for this <acronym>SRFI</acronym> addresses this dilemma by offering options.
</p>
<p>Another alternative for dealing with the dispatching problem is adding
an optional argument to the syntax of <code>:</code> through which the
dispatcher can be passed explicitly.  However, as <code>:</code> has variable
arity and the identifier for the variable cannot be distinguished from
any value for a dispatcher, this is syntactically problematic.
</p>

<a name="Why-is-there-no-local-mechanism-for-adding-to-_003a_003f"></a>
<h4 class="subsubheading">Why is there no local mechanism for adding to <code>:</code>?</h4>

<p>According to <acronym>R5RS</acronym> Section 7.1.6 macros can only be defined at the
level of the <code>&lt;program&gt;</code> syntax.  This implies that the scope of
typed generators cannot easily be limited to local scopes.  As typed and
dispatched generators go together, there is also no strong need for a
limited scope of dispatched generators either.  Furthermore, locally
extendable dispatchers are another major headache to those trying to
understand other people&rsquo;s code.
</p>

<a name="Why-are-dispatchers-unary_003f"></a>
<h4 class="subsubheading">Why are dispatchers unary?</h4>

<p>As defined in <code>:dispatched</code>, a dispatching procedure is called with
a single argument being the list of values to dispatch on.  An
alternative is to apply the dispatcher to the list of values to dispatch
on, which would be more natural in Scheme.
</p>
<p>The reason for not using apply is a minor improvement in efficiency.
Every time <var>apply</var> is used on a procedure of variable arity, an
object containing the argument list is allocated on the heap.  As a
dispatcher may call many other dispatchers, this will add to the
overhead of dispatching, which is relevant in inner loops.
</p>

<a name="Why-are-there-two-fold-comprehensions_003f"></a>
<h4 class="subsubheading">Why are there two fold comprehensions?</h4>

<p>The reason for having two fold comprehensions (<code>fold-ec</code> and
<code>fold3-ec</code>) is efficiency.
</p>
<p>Clearly, the more general construction is <code>fold3-ec</code> as it allows
individual treatment of the empty sequence case and the singleton
sequence case.  However, this comes at the price of more book&ndash;keeping
as can be seen from the implementation example.  As the overhead is
located within inner loops, it makes sense to define another fold
comprehension for the case where the added flexibility is not needed.
This is <code>fold-ec</code>.
</p>
<p>The names <code>fold-ec</code> and <code>fold3-ec</code> have been chosen for the
comprehensions in order to stay clear any other &rsquo;fold&rsquo; that may be
around.
</p>

<a name="Why-is-_003achar_002drange-not-defined-by-integer_002d_003echar_003f"></a>
<h4 class="subsubheading">Why is <code>:char-range</code> not defined by <code>integer-&gt;char</code>?</h4>

<p>The definition of <code>:char-range</code> specifies a sequence of adjacent
characters ordered by <code>char&lt;=?</code>.  The reason for not using
<code>char-&gt;integer</code> and <code>integer-&gt;char</code> is the fact that <acronym>R5RS</acronym>
Section 6.3.4 leaves it to the implementation whether the integers
representing characters are consecutive or not.  In effect, this
underspecification is inherited by <code>:char-range</code>.
