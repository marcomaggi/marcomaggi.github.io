<h4 class="subsubsection">2.2.4.1 General discussion</h4>


<p>A set of general criteria guided the design of this library.
</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t require &ldquo;destructive&rdquo; (what I call &ldquo;linear update&rdquo;)
procedures to alter and recycle cons cells from the argument lists.
They are allowed to, but not required to.  (And the reference
implementations I have written do recycle the argument lists.)
</p>
<p>List&ndash;filtering procedures such as <code>filter</code> or <code>delete</code> do not
disorder lists.  Elements appear in the answer list in the same order as
they appear in the argument list.  This constrains implementation, but
seems like a desirable feature, since in many uses of lists, order
matters.  (In particular, disordering an alist is definitely a bad
idea.)
</p>
<p>Contrariwise, although the reference implementations of the
list&ndash;filtering procedures share longest common tails between argument
and answer lists, it not is part of the spec.
</p>
<p>Because lists are an inherently sequential data structure (unlike, say,
vectors), list&ndash;inspection functions such as <code>find</code>,
<code>find-tail</code>, <code>for-each</code>, any and every commit to a
left&ndash;to&ndash;right traversal order of their argument list.
</p>
<p>However, constructor functions, such as <code>list-tabulate</code> and the
mapping procedures (<code>append-map</code>, <code>append-map!</code>, <code>map!</code>,
<code>pair-for-each</code>, <code>filter-map</code>, <code>map-in-order</code>), do not
specify the dynamic order in which their procedural argument is applied
to its various values.
</p>
<p>Predicates return useful true values wherever possible.  Thus any must
return the true value produced by its predicate, and every returns the
final true value produced by applying its predicate argument to the last
element of its argument list.
</p>
<p>Functionality is provided both in pure and linear&ndash;update (potentially
destructive) forms wherever this makes sense.
</p>
<p>No special status accorded Scheme&rsquo;s built&ndash;in equality functions.  Any
functionality provided in terms of <code>eq?</code>, <code>eqv?</code>,
<code>equal?</code> is also available using a client&ndash;provided equality
function.
</p>
<p>Proper design counts for more than backwards compatibility, but I have
tried, ceteris paribus, to be as backwards&ndash;compatible as possible with
existing list&ndash;processing libraries, in order to facilitate porting old
code to run as a client of the procedures in this library.  Name choices
and semantics are, for the most part, in agreement with existing
practice in many current Scheme systems.  I have indicated some
incompatibilities in the following text.
</p>
<p>These procedures are not &ldquo;sequence generic&rdquo;&mdash;-i.e. procedures that
operate on either vectors and lists.  They are list&ndash;specific.  I prefer
to keep the library simple and focused.
</p>
<p>I have named these procedures without a qualifying initial <code>list-</code>
lexeme, which is in keeping with the existing set of list&ndash;processing
utilities in Scheme.  I follow the general Scheme convention
(<code>vector-length</code>, <code>string-ref</code>) of placing the type&ndash;name
before the action when naming procedures&mdash;-so we have <code>list-copy</code>
and <code>pair-for-each</code> rather than the perhaps more fluid, but less
consistent, <code>copy-list</code> or <code>for-each-pair</code>.
</p>
<p>I have generally followed a regular and consistent naming scheme,
composing procedure names from a set of basic lexemes.
