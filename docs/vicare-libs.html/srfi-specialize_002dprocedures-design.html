<h4 class="subsection">2.15.5 Rationale design</h4>


<a name="Why-not-real-currying_002funcurrying_003f"></a>
<h4 class="subsubheading">Why not real currying/uncurrying?</h4>

<p>It is possible in Scheme to implement a macro turning a multi&ndash;argument
procedure into a nesting of single&ndash;argument procedures and back.  These
operations are usually called &ldquo;curry&rdquo; and &ldquo;uncurry&rdquo; in other
programming languages.
</p>
<p>Yet, Scheme remains an inherently uncurried language and is not prepared
to deal with curried procedures in a convenient way.  Hence, a &ldquo;by the
book&rdquo; implementation of currying would only be useful if you apply it
in the sequence &ldquo;curry, specialize some arguments, and uncurry again&rdquo;,
which is exactly the purpose of the macro <code>cut</code> specified in this
document.  The primary relevance of currying/uncurrying in Scheme is to
teach concepts of combinatory logic.
</p>

<a name="Why-not-a-more-general-mechanism_002c-also-allowing-permutation-omission-and-duplication-of-arguments_003f"></a>
<h4 class="subsubheading">Why not a more general mechanism, also allowing permutation omission and duplication of arguments?</h4>

<p>The reason is that I, the author of this <acronym>SRFI</acronym>, consider more general
mechanisms too dangerous to mix them with the mechanism proposed here.
In particular, as soon as parameters are being rearranged it is usually
necessary to be aware of the meaning of the parameters; unnamed
variables can be quite harmful then.  The mechanism proposed here is
designed to prevent this.
</p>
<p>Please refer to the discussion threads &ldquo;OK, how about...,&rdquo; (Alan
Bawden), &ldquo;is that useful?&rdquo; (Walter C.  Pelissero), and &ldquo;l, the
ultimate curry that is not curry&rdquo; (Al Petrofsky).
</p>

<a name="Why-are-the-macro-called-cut_002fcute-and-not-_005benter-your-favourite-here_005d_003f"></a>
<h4 class="subsubheading">Why are the macro called <code>cut</code>/<code>cute</code> and not [enter your favourite here]?</h4>

<p>Well, the original name proposed for this <acronym>SRFI</acronym> was <code>curry</code>
which immediately stirred some emotions as it does not what is commonly
known as currying.  Some alternatives have been discussed, such as:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">section         specialise      specialize,
partial-apply   partial-call    partial-lambda,
_j              _i              $
&amp;               srfi-26         foobar
xyz             schoenfinkelize curry-which-isnt-curry
tandoori
</pre></div>

<p>and it has also been suggested to pick a five letter symbol uniformly at
random and fix this as a name.  To be fair, not all of these name have
been put forward as serious proposals, some of them were merely to
illustrate a point in the discussion.  In addition, I have played with
the game of the name quite a bit and considered other candidates not
listed here.
</p>
<p>Despite the fact that the discussion list only represents a highly
biased random sample of people&rsquo;s opinion (motivation to post a message
is higher if you disagree, for example) it told me that the <acronym>SRFI</acronym>
could potentially benefit from a different name; however impractical it
may be to go for unanimous popularity.
</p>
<p>The name <code>cut</code> refers to &ldquo;operator section&rdquo;, as the concept is
often called in other programming languages, but I tend to remember it
as the acronym for &ldquo;Curry Upon This&rdquo;. ;-) The names for the evaluating
version of <code>cut</code> that have been proposed were <code>cut!</code>,
<code>cutlet</code>, <code>cut*</code>, and <code>cute</code>.
</p>

<a name="Is-it-possible-to-implement-the-SRFI-without-macros_003f"></a>
<h4 class="subsubheading">Is it possible to implement the <acronym>SRFI</acronym> without macros?</h4>

<p>Not really.  As Stephan Houben has pointed out during the discussion
(refer to &ldquo;Implementing it as a procedure&rdquo;) it is possible to
implement the <code>cute</code>&ndash;mechanism as a procedure.  Refer also to Al
Petrofsky&rsquo;s posting &ldquo;Problems with <em>curry</em>&rsquo;s formal
specification&rdquo; for details.
</p>
<p>However, the procedural implementation comes with a slight performance
penalty and it is not possible the implement the <code>cut</code>&ndash;mechanism
as a procedure, too.
</p>
<p>As both are needed, we rely on macros to implement the <acronym>SRFI</acronym>.  Why is
there another symbol for the rest&ndash;slot when <code>lambda</code>&ndash;expressions
use the dotted notation for variable length argument lists?  There are
two reasons.  The first one is the existence of a procedural
implementation of a related mechanism (refer to the previous paragraph).
For a procedure, however, it is not possible to have dotted notation.
The second reason is the way the hygienic macro mechanism in <acronym>R5RS</acronym> is
defined to deal with dotted notation, as Felix Winkelmann has pointed
out.  Refer to the discussion threads &ldquo;Improper lists in macros [WAS:
none]&rdquo;.
</p>

<a name="Why-is-it-impossible-to-specify-when-a-non_002d_002dslot-is-evaluate-individually-per-non_002d_002dslot_003f"></a>
<h4 class="subsubheading">Why is it impossible to specify when a non&ndash;slot is evaluate individually per non&ndash;slot?</h4>

<p><code>cut</code> evaluates all non&ndash;slots at the time the specialized
procedure is called and <code>cute</code> evaluates all non&ndash;slots at the time
the procedure is being specialized.  These are only the two extremes and
it is possible to define a syntax that allows to choose per non&ndash;slot.
However, I am convinced that the benefit of the greater flexibility is
not worth the risk of confusion.  If a piece of code really depends on
the distinction, it might be better to make this explicit through
<code>let</code> and <code>lambda</code>.
</p>

<a name="Why-is-_0028cut-if-_003c_003e-0-1_0029-etc_002e-illegal_003f"></a>
<h4 class="subsubheading">Why is <code>(cut if &lt;&gt; 0 1)</code> etc. illegal?</h4>

<p>It is specified that a <code>&lt;slot-or-expr&gt;</code> must be either the slot
symbol or an <code>&lt;expression&gt;</code> in the sense of <acronym>R5RS</acronym>, Section
7.1.3.  As if is no <code>&lt;expression&gt;</code>, the above case is illegal.  The
reason why <code>cut</code> and <code>cute</code> are restricted in this sense is
the difficulty of defining the meaning of such generalized expressions.
Please refer to the discussion archive for details.
