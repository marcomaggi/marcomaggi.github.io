<h4 class="subsection">2.32.2 Rationale</h4>


<p>In most programming languages, records (aka structures or classes) are
important because they can package component values of different types
into a single object.
</p>
<p>Scheme&rsquo;s vectors and procedures provided that capability already, but
records remained important for two reasons:
</p>
<ul>
<li> Records make it easier to index components by their names.

</li><li> Records can introduce new types in the sense that all previous type
predicates return false for instances of the new record type, while the
new predicate associated with the new record type returns true only for
instances of the new record type.
</li></ul>

<p>For many programmers, records were the most important new feature of the
<acronym>R6RS</acronym>, but the specific record systems that were proposed by the
<acronym>R6RS</acronym> have been widely criticized.  Over 30% of those who voted
against ratification mentioned the record systems as one of their
reasons.
</p>
<p>The <acronym>ERR5RS</acronym> record system described by this <acronym>SRFI</acronym> provides a
simpler and fully portable alternative to the <acronym>R6RS</acronym> record system.
The <acronym>ERR5RS</acronym> record system consists of:
</p>
<ul>
<li> a syntactic layer, which is fully compatible with <acronym>SRFI</acronym>-9 but extends
<acronym>SRFI</acronym>-9 with inheritance and with more succinct syntax for common use
cases;

</li><li> a procedural layer, which is simpler and easier to use than the
procedural layer of <acronym>R6RS</acronym> records but remains fully compatible with
the <acronym>R6RS</acronym> procedural layer;

</li><li> an inspection layer, which is simpler and easier to use than the
inspection layer of <acronym>R6RS</acronym> records but remains fully compatible with
the <acronym>R6RS</acronym> inspection layer.
</li></ul>

<p>The <acronym>ERR5RS</acronym> record system does not mandate support for the
non&ndash;generative, sealed, and/or opaque features of the <acronym>R6RS</acronym> record
system.  Implementations of this <acronym>SRFI</acronym> may extend the <acronym>ERR5RS</acronym>
record system to support those features, however, and this <acronym>SRFI</acronym>
recommends an <acronym>API</acronym> to implementations that support those features.
With those extensions, the <acronym>ERR5RS</acronym> record system has the same
expressive power as the <acronym>R6RS</acronym> record system.  Hence the record system
described by this <acronym>SRFI</acronym> can serve as either or both of the following:
</p>
<ul>
<li> an efficient and relatively simple foundation for implementing the
<acronym>R6RS</acronym> record system;

</li><li> a simpler and fully portable alternative to the <acronym>R6RS</acronym> record system.
</li></ul>

<p>The following subsections develop the rationale for this <acronym>SRFI</acronym> by
considering:
</p>
<ul>
<li> the history of records in Scheme before the <acronym>R6RS</acronym>;

</li><li> <acronym>R6RS</acronym> records;

</li><li> the design rationale for <acronym>ERR5RS</acronym> records.
</li></ul>


<a name="Records-before-R6RS"></a>
<h4 class="subsubsection">2.32.2.1 Records before <acronym>R6RS</acronym></h4>

<p>The importance of adding records to Scheme has been recognized for more
than twenty years. The basic idea behind the <acronym>SRFI</acronym>-9 and <acronym>R6RS</acronym>
record systems was outlined by Norman Adams on 8 July 1987, following
similar ideas that had been implemented in T and MIT CScheme.  Jonathan
Rees posted a revision of Adams&rsquo;s proposal on 26 May 1988.  Pavel Curtis
proposed an extension of Rees&rsquo;s proposal on 18 August 1989, noting that
it had been approved by consensus at the first meeting of BASH (Bay Area
Scheme Hackers?).  The <code>rrrs-authors</code> archive includes several
responses to these proposals that are worth reading.
</p>
<p>The Rees/Curtis proposal was revived in 1992.  When the <acronym>RnRS</acronym> authors
met on 25 June 1992 in Palo Alto, they felt that this proposal needed
more discussion.  Kent Dybvig objected to the proposal on several
grounds, including the provision of inspection facilities, the inability
to define immutable records, and the use of procedures instead of
special forms.  Although 9 authors favored adoption of the records
proposal, 11 opposed it.
</p>
<p>The topic of records was revived again on 23 April 1996 by Bruce Duba,
Matthew Flatt, and Shriram Krishnamurthi.  Alan Bawden and Richard
Kelsey observed that the Duba/Flatt/Krishnamurthi proposal was
essentially the same as Pavel Curtis&rsquo;s, which Kelsey reposted.  Kent
Dybvig objected once again, on the same three grounds.  He also argued
that procedural interfaces are difficult to compile efficiently, and
that this inefficiency would create portability problems.
</p>
<p>In reality, however, procedural interfaces add no inefficiency.  It is
now agreed that syntactic interfaces offer no advantages for generative
records.  Even for non&ndash;generative records, the claimed inefficiency
consists of a single load instruction, which optimizing compilers can
eliminate &mdash; along with the entire runtime check that includes the load
instruction &mdash; for all but the first of a sequence of operations that
access the same record.  (That optimization is a straightforward
extension of the optimization that eliminates the pair check when
computing the cdr of a list whose car has already been computed.)
Furthermore, it turns out that even the occasional load instruction is
no harder to remove using a procedural interface than when using a
syntactic interface.  In <acronym>R6RS</acronym> library chapter 6, therefore, both of
the statements that claim an advantage in efficiency for the syntactic
layer have no basis in fact.  (These two statements appear in the
next&ndash;to&ndash;last paragraph before section 6.1, and in the note that
follows the specification of <code>parent-rtd</code>.)
</p>
<p>On 24 April 1996, Bill Rozas suggested the idea of having two separate
<acronym>API</acronym>s, one procedural and one syntactic, for the same record facility.
Two days later, Dybvig proposed a compromise along those lines that
incorporated several artificial restrictions, which were apparently
motivated by concerns about the alleged extra load instruction.  Dybvig
and Rozas continued to develop this proposal, and presented a summary of
it following the 1998 Scheme Workshop.  I have been unable to locate a
written or online copy of this proposal.
</p>
<p><acronym>SRFI</acronym>-9, submitted by Richard Kelsey in July 1999, is a syntactic
<acronym>API</acronym> in the tradition of the Rees, Curtis, and
Duba/Flatt/Krishnamurthi proposals.
</p>
<p>Single inheritance was added by Larceny in 1998, and by Chez Scheme in
1999.
</p>
<p><acronym>SRFI</acronym> 57, submitted by Andre van Tonder in September 2004, features
label polymorphism, which can be considered a form of structural
subtyping and multiple inheritance.
</p>

<a name="R6RS-Records"></a>
<h4 class="subsubsection">2.32.2.2 <acronym>R6RS</acronym> Records</h4>


<p>The <acronym>R6RS</acronym> proposes a three&ndash;layer single inheritance system, with
syntactic, procedural, and inspection layers.
</p>

<a name="R6RS-Records_003a-procedural-layer"></a>
<h4 class="subsubheading"><acronym>R6RS</acronym> Records: procedural layer</h4>


<p>The <acronym>R6RS</acronym> procedural layer generally requires at least three separate
definitions for each level of inheritance: the record&ndash;type descriptor,
at least one record&ndash;constructor descriptor, and an actual constructor
(if instances of the record&ndash;type are to be created).
</p>
<p>The (unratified) <acronym>R6RS</acronym> rationale describes the
constructor&ndash;descriptor mechanism as &ldquo;an infrastructure for creating
specialized constructors, rather than just creating default constructors
that accept the initial values of all the fields as arguments. This
infrastructure achieves full generality while leaving each level of an
inheritance hierarchy in control over its own fields and allowing child
record definitions to be abstracted away from the actual number and
contents of parent fields.&rdquo;  Neither the (ratified) <acronym>R6RS</acronym> library
document nor the (unratified) <acronym>R6RS</acronym> rationale consider the fact that
the constructor&ndash;descriptor mechanism adds unnecessary complexity to
what is by far the most common case: record definitions that do not
require specialized constructors.  Neither document considers the fact
that the benefits of the constructor&ndash;descriptor mechanism are small
even when specialized constructors are needed, as in the first example
below.
</p>
<p>The <acronym>R6RS</acronym> library specification of records says that a record type is
&ldquo;specified by a record&ndash;type descriptor, which is an object that
specifies the fields of the record and various other properties that all
records of that type share.&rdquo;  Since the record&ndash;type descriptor is an
object, it can be the value of a variable that is exported by a library.
As discussed below, however, the <acronym>R6RS</acronym> syntactic layer uses a
different notion of record type that may be neither object nor syntax.
</p>

<a name="R6RS-records_003a-syntactic-layer"></a>
<h4 class="subsubheading"><acronym>R6RS</acronym> records: syntactic layer</h4>


<p>The <acronym>R6RS</acronym> syntactic layer consists of a <code>define-record-type</code>
syntax that is incompatible with the syntaxes of the same name defined
by <acronym>SRFI</acronym>-9 and <acronym>SRFI</acronym>-99 (this <acronym>SRFI</acronym>).
</p>
<p>According to <acronym>R6RS</acronym> library section 6.2, an <acronym>R6RS</acronym>
<code>define-record-type</code> form binds the record name &ldquo;to an
expand&ndash;time or run&ndash;time representation of the record type [that] can
be used as parent name in syntactic record&ndash;type definitions that extend
this definition.  It can also be used as a handle to gain access to the
underlying record&ndash;type descriptor and constructor descriptor&rdquo;.
</p>
<p>Note that portable code cannot assume the record name is bound to a
record&ndash;type descriptor.  Portable code can only assume that the record
name is bound to &ldquo;an expand&ndash;time or run&ndash;time representation&rdquo;, whose
semantics is not otherwise explained by the <acronym>R6RS</acronym> and <acronym>R6RS</acronym>
library documents.  In particular, it is far from obvious that portable
code can export the record name from a library; libraries can export
names that are bound to objects or to syntax, but the <acronym>R6RS</acronym> does not
require the denotation of a record name to be either of those things.
</p>
<p>The mysterious entity to which a record name is bound can be used as a
handle to recover a record&ndash;type descriptor or constructor descriptor by
using the <code>record-type-descriptor</code> or
<code>record-constructor-descriptor</code> syntaxes, respectively.  The
recovered record&ndash;type descriptor and constructor descriptor may be
exported from a library, and that is apparently the only portable way
for a library to export an <acronym>R6RS</acronym> record type that was defined using
the <acronym>R6RS</acronym> syntactic layer.
</p>
<p>The recovered record&ndash;type descriptor and constructor descriptor also
provide a way for the procedural layer to define new record types that
inherit from record types defined by the syntactic layer.  Similarly, it
is possible for the syntactic layer to use a <code>parent-rtd</code> clause to
define new record types that inherit from record types defined by the
procedural layer.
</p>
<p>The two notions of record type that are used by the procedural and
syntactic layers are not interchangeable, however.  In either direction,
defining a new record type that inherits from some previously defined
record type requires the programmer to know whether the previously
defined record type was defined using the procedural or the syntactic
layer.  If the procedural and syntactic layers of the <acronym>R6RS</acronym> were
fully compatible, then changing a record type definition from procedural
to syntactic (or vice versa) would be transparent to clients.  As the
<acronym>R6RS</acronym> record facility is defined, however, that minor change will
break all code that inherits from the record type.
</p>
<p><acronym>R6RS</acronym> library chapter 6 attempts to excuse that incompatibility, and
the interoperability and maintenance problems that result from it, on
the basis of efficiency.  Recall, however, that the claimed efficiency
of the <acronym>R6RS</acronym> syntactic layer is illusory.  In reality, the <acronym>R6RS</acronym>
design offers no advantages over a simpler and more orthogonal design
(such as the one specified by this <acronym>SRFI</acronym>) in which the syntactic and
procedural layers both use the same notion of record type.
</p>
<p>The problems described above were known and had been documented before
the <acronym>R6RS</acronym> documents were put to a vote, but the <acronym>R6RS</acronym> documents
were ratified anyway.  At this point, the best that can be done is to
use the <acronym>SRFI</acronym> process to specify a better record facility, and to warn
programmers of the problems they will encounter if they use the record
facilities described within the <acronym>R6RS</acronym> library document.
</p>

<a name="Design-Rationale-for-ERR5RS-Records"></a>
<h4 class="subsubsection">2.32.2.3 Design Rationale for <acronym>ERR5RS</acronym> Records</h4>


<p>The <acronym>ERR5RS</acronym> syntactic layer described by this <acronym>SRFI</acronym> is based
upon the Rees/Curtis/Duba/Flatt/Krishnamurthi/Kelsey/<acronym>SRFI</acronym>-9
tradition, changing only a few details to improve interoperability with
records defined by the <acronym>ERR5RS</acronym> and <acronym>R6RS</acronym> procedural layers.
</p>
<p>The <code>define-record-type</code> syntax specified by this <acronym>SRFI</acronym> is
compatible with and extends <acronym>SRFI</acronym>-9, which is one of the more widely
accepted <acronym>SRFI</acronym>s.  The extensions include single inheritance and
(optional) implicit naming, along with succinct abbreviations for
specifying whether a field is immutable or mutable.
</p>
<p>The procedural layer specified by this <acronym>SRFI</acronym> is fully compatible with
its <code>define-record-type</code> syntax.  Both the procedural and syntactic
layers can define new record types that inherit from previously defined
record types without requiring programmers to know which layer was used
to define the parent type.
</p>
<p>In implementations of the <acronym>R6RS</acronym>, a <acronym>SRFI</acronym>-99 record type coincides
with the <acronym>R6RS</acronym> notion of a record&ndash;type descriptor.  Portable
libraries can safely export <acronym>SRFI</acronym>-99 record types even if they were
defined using the syntactic layer of <acronym>SRFI</acronym>-99.
</p>
<p>In procedure names, <acronym>SRFI</acronym>-99 uses <code>rtd</code> as an abbreviation for
record&ndash;type descriptor.  This naming convention prevents name clashes
between <acronym>SRFI</acronym>-99 and the <acronym>R6RS</acronym> procedural and inspection layers,
which makes it easier for <acronym>R6RS</acronym> programs to import <acronym>SRFI</acronym>-99
libraries.  <acronym>R6RS</acronym> programs must take care when importing the <acronym>R6RS</acronym>
syntactic layer, however, because that library&rsquo;s exports conflict with
both <acronym>SRFI</acronym>-9 and with <acronym>SRFI</acronym>-99.
</p>
<p>When implemented properly, <acronym>SRFI</acronym>-99 records will be just as efficient
as <acronym>R6RS</acronym> records.  <acronym>SRFI</acronym>-99 is simpler than <acronym>R6RS</acronym> records, both
in specification and in implementation.  <acronym>SRFI</acronym>-99 is strictly less
powerful than the <acronym>R6RS</acronym> records facility because <acronym>SRFI</acronym>-99 does not
require implementations to provide sealed, opaque, or non&ndash;generative
records.  On the other hand, <acronym>SRFI</acronym>-99 describes three optional
extensions (the <var>sealed</var>, <var>opaque</var>, and <var>uid</var> arguments to
<code>make-rtd</code>) that would give <acronym>SRFI</acronym>-99 the same power as <acronym>R6RS</acronym>
records.  With those three extensions, <acronym>SRFI</acronym>-99 would become a simple
and efficient foundation for implementing <acronym>R6RS</acronym> records.
</p>
<p>The record system described by this <acronym>SRFI</acronym> has been implemented in
Larceny.  It is the primary record system used by Larceny&rsquo;s
implementation of the <acronym>R6RS</acronym>, including the <code>(rnrs records
syntactic (6))</code> library.  Larceny demonstrates both the efficiency of
<acronym>ERR5RS</acronym> records and the ease of interoperability between
<acronym>SRFI</acronym>-9, <acronym>ERR5RS</acronym>, and the procedural and inspection layers of
<acronym>R6RS</acronym> records.
</p>

<a name="Issues-3"></a>
<h4 class="subsubsection">2.32.2.4 Issues</h4>

<ul>
<li> <acronym>ERR5RS</acronym> records support single inheritance.

</li><li> <acronym>ERR5RS</acronym> records do not support the non&ndash;generative feature of
<acronym>R6RS</acronym> records.  (To show how <acronym>SRFI</acronym>-99 could be extended to provide
all useful features of <acronym>R6RS</acronym> records, <acronym>SRFI</acronym>-99 describes an
optional extension for non&ndash;generativity, and the reference
implementation shows how that extension is implemented in Larceny, but
that extension is not part of <acronym>SRFI</acronym>-99&rsquo;s <acronym>API</acronym>.)

</li><li> <acronym>ERR5RS</acronym> records do not support the optional &ldquo;sealed&rdquo; feature
of <acronym>R6RS</acronym> records.  (To show how <acronym>SRFI</acronym>-99 could be extended to
provide all useful features of <acronym>R6RS</acronym> records, <acronym>SRFI</acronym>-99 describes an
optional extension for sealed records, and the reference implementation
shows how that extension is implemented in Larceny, but that extension
is not part of <acronym>SRFI</acronym>-99&rsquo;s <acronym>API</acronym>.)

</li><li> <acronym>ERR5RS</acronym> records do not support the optional &ldquo;opaque&rdquo; feature
of <acronym>R6RS</acronym> records.  (To show how <acronym>SRFI</acronym>-99 could be extended to
provide all useful features of <acronym>R6RS</acronym> records, <acronym>SRFI</acronym>-99 describes an
optional extension for opaque records, and the reference implementation
shows how that extension is implemented in Larceny, but that extension
is not part of <acronym>SRFI</acronym>-99&rsquo;s <acronym>API</acronym>.)

</li><li> <acronym>ERR5RS</acronym> records do not support the record&ndash;constructor
descriptors of <acronym>R6RS</acronym> records.  (Even so, <acronym>ERR5RS</acronym> records are
compatible with the <code>make-record-constructor-descriptor</code> procedure
of the <acronym>R6RS</acronym>.  Larceny, for example, allows that procedure to be used
with <acronym>ERR5RS</acronym> record type descriptors.)

</li><li> <acronym>ERR5RS</acronym> records support the per&ndash;field mutable/immutable
feature of <acronym>R6RS</acronym> records.

</li><li> The <code>define-record-type</code> syntax provides succinct defaults for both
immutable and mutable fields.  An identifier&ndash;only field spec implies
immutability.  When enclosed within parentheses, a single identifier
implies mutability.

</li><li> <acronym>ERR5RS</acronym> records are partitioned into a procedural layer, an
inspection layer, and a syntactic layer.  (The primary reason for
separating the procedural layer from the inspection layer is to simplify
comparisons with <acronym>R6RS</acronym> records.)

</li><li> The <code>make-rtd</code> procedure accepts a vector of field specifiers
instead of a list of field specifiers.  (This is carried over from the
corresponding procedure of the <acronym>R6RS</acronym> procedural layer.)
</li></ul>
