<h4 class="subsection">2.12.4 Specification</h4>


<dl>
<dt><a name="index-error"></a>Function: <strong>error</strong> <em><var>reason</var> [<var>arg1</var> [<var>arg2</var> ...]])</em></dt>
<dd><p>The argument <var>reason</var> should be a string.  The procedure error will
signal an error, as described in <acronym>R5RS</acronym>, and it will report the
message <var>reason</var> and the objects <var>arg1</var>, <var>arg2</var>, ...
</p>
<p>What exactly constitutes &ldquo;signalling&rdquo; and &ldquo;reporting&rdquo; is not
prescribed, because of the large variation in Scheme systems.  So it is
left to the implementor to do something reasonable.  To that end, a few
examples of possible behaviour are given.
</p>
<ol>
<li> Display <var>reason</var> and <var>arg1</var>... on the screen and terminate the
Scheme program.  This might be suitable for a Scheme system implemented
as a batch compiler.

</li><li> Display <var>reason</var> and <var>arg1</var>... on the screen and go back to the
read&ndash;evaluate&ndash;print loop.  This might be suitable for an interactive
implementation.

</li><li> In the case of a multi&ndash;threaded system: terminate the current thread,
but do not terminate the other threads.  Possibly make the arguments to
error available to other threads in some way.  See the
<code>thread-join!</code>  mechanism in <acronym>SRFI</acronym>-18 on how this could be done.

</li><li> Package <var>reason</var> and <var>arg1</var>... up into an error object and pass
this error object to an exception handler.  The default exception
handler then might do something as described in points 1 to 3.

</li><li> In the case of a Scheme system that runs completely unattended and that
has no way to notify a human, the only reasonable course of action might
be to do nothing at all.  However, this should be considered a last
resort.  Clearly, if all implementors would choose this strategy, this
<acronym>SRFI</acronym> would not be very useful.
</li></ol>

<p>An implementation might report more information than just <var>reason</var>
and <var>arg1</var>...  For instance, it might report the procedure name in
which the error occured or even print a stack trace.  However, this will
require additional support in the Scheme implementation.
</p></dd></dl>



<a name="Why-error-is-a-procedure"></a>
<h4 class="subsubheading">Why error is a procedure</h4>


<p>It is conceivable to allow error to be a special form, such as a macro,
rather than a procedure.  This might make providing information such as
the source code location easier.  This possibility has been considered,
but rejected, for two reasons.
</p>
<ol>
<li> Since error accepts a variable number of arguments, it could
occasionally be useful to use apply to call error.  However, this is not
possible if error was allowed to be a special form.

</li><li> Since error is currently a procedure in all Scheme implementations
mentioned above, it doesn&rsquo;t seem all that worthwhile to allow it to be a
special form.
</li></ol>
