<h5 class="subsubsection">2.2.4.3 Improper Lists</h5>

<p>Scheme does not properly have a list type, just as the C language does
not have a string type.  Rather, Scheme has a binary&ndash;tuple type, from
which one can build binary trees.  There is an interpretation of Scheme
values that allows one to treat these trees as lists.  Further
complications ensue from the fact that Scheme allows side&ndash;effects to
these tuples, raising the possibility of lists of unbounded length, and
trees of unbounded depth (that is, circular data structures).

   <p>However, there is a simple view of the world of Scheme values that
considers every value to be a list of some sort.  That is, every value
is either:

     <ul>
<li>a &ldquo;proper list&rdquo; (a finite, nil&ndash;terminated list) such as:

     <pre class="example">          (a b c)
          ()
          (32)
</pre>
     <li>a &ldquo;dotted list&rdquo; (a finite, non&ndash;nil terminated list) such as:

     <pre class="example">          (a b c . d)
          (x . y)
          42
          george
</pre>
     <li>or a &ldquo;circular list&rdquo; (an infinite, unterminated list). 
</ul>

   <p>Note that the zero&ndash;length dotted lists are simply all the non&ndash;null,
non&ndash;pair values.

   <p>This view is captured by the predicates <code>proper-list?</code>,
<code>dotted-list?</code>, and <code>circular-list?</code>.  This list library users
should note that dotted lists are not commonly used, and are considered
by many Scheme programmers to be an ugly artifact of Scheme's lack of a
true list type.  However, dotted lists do play a noticeable role in the
syntax of Scheme, in the &ldquo;rest&rdquo; parameters used by n&ndash;ary lambdas:

<pre class="example">     (lambda (x y . rest) ...)
</pre>
   <p>Dotted lists are not fully supported by this list library.  Most
procedures are defined only on proper lists, that is: finite,
nil&ndash;terminated lists.  The procedures that will also handle circular or
dotted lists are specifically marked.  While this design decision
restricts the domain of possible arguments one can pass to these
procedures, it has the benefit of allowing the procedures to catch the
error cases where programmers inadvertently pass scalar values to a list
procedure by accident, e.g., by switching the arguments to a procedure
call.
