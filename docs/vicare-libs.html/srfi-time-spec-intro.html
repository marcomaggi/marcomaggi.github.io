<h5 class="subsubsection">2.11.3.1 Introduction</h5>

<p>A <code>time</code> object, which is distinct from all existing types, defines
a point in time or a time duration in some standard time system.  The
standard time systems are:

     <ul>
<li>Universal Coordinated Time (<acronym>UTC</acronym>),

     <li>International Atomic Time (<acronym>TAI</acronym>),

     <li>monotonic time (a monotonically increasing point in time equal to
<acronym>TAI</acronym>),

     <li><acronym>CPU</acronym> time in current thread (not implemented by Vicare),

     <li><acronym>CPU</acronym> time in current process (not implemented by Vicare),

     <li>time duration. 
</ul>

   <p>Implementations are required to implement <acronym>UTC</acronym>, monotonic time, <acronym>CPU</acronym>
time in current process, and time duration.  Implementations are allowed
to create extensions (for example, amount of time spent in garbage
collection).

   <p>A <code>time</code> object consists of three components:

     <dl>
<dt><em>Time type</em><dd>A symbol representing the time system representation used.  The
constants <code>time-tai</code>, <code>time-utc</code>, <code>time-monotonic</code>,
<code>time-thread</code>, <code>time-process</code>, and <code>time-duration</code> must
be provided for these symbols.  Implementations should provide constants
for time type extensions.

     <br><dt><em>Second</em><dd>An integer representing the number of whole seconds from &ldquo;the epoch&rdquo;.

     <br><dt><em>Nanosecond</em><dd>An integer of the number of nanoseconds in the fractional portion. 
Although a time object has nanosecond precision, clocks may have a lower
resolution. 
</dl>

   <p>A <code>date</code> object, which is distinct from all existing types,
represents a point in time as represented by the Gregorian calendar as
well as by a time zone.  <code>date</code> objects are immutable.  A
<code>date</code> object consists of the following components:

     <dl>
<dt><em>Nanosecond</em><dd>An integer between 0 and 999,999,999, inclusive.

     <br><dt><em>Second</em><dd>An integer 0 and 60, inclusive, (60 represents a leap second).

     <br><dt><em>Minute</em><dd>An integer between 0 and 59, inclusive.

     <br><dt><em>Hour</em><dd>An integer between 0 and 23, inclusive.

     <br><dt><em>Day</em><dd>An integer between 0 and 31, inclusive, the upper limit depending on the
month and year of the point in time.

     <br><dt><em>Month</em><dd>An integer between 1 and 12, inclusive; in which 1 means January, 2
February, and so on.

     <br><dt><em>Year</em><dd>An integer representing the year.

     <br><dt><em>Time zone</em><dd>A integer the number of seconds east of GMT for this timezone. 
</dl>

   <p>A <dfn>Julian Day</dfn> represents a point in time as a real number of days
since -4714-11-24T12:00:00Z (November 24, -4714 at noon, <acronym>UTC</acronym>).

   <p>A <dfn>Modified Julian Day</dfn> represents a point in time as a real number
of days since 1858-11-17T00:00:00Z (November 17, 1858 at midnight,
<acronym>UTC</acronym>).
