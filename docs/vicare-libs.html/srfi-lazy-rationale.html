<h4 class="subsection">2.24.2 Rationale</h4>


<p>Wadler et al. in the paper <em>How to add laziness to a strict
language without even being odd</em> [Wad98], provide a straightforward
recipe for transforming arbitrary lazy data structures and algorithms
into a strict language using <code>delay</code> and <code>force</code>.
</p>
<p>However, it is known (see e.g. the <acronym>SRFI</acronym>-40 discussion list) that
this transformation can lead to programs that suffer from unbounded
space consumption, even if the original lazy algorithm was properly
tail&ndash;recursive.  Example Consider the following procedure, written in a
hypothetical lazy language with Scheme syntax:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">(define (stream-filter p? s)
  (if (null? s) '()
      (let ((h (car s))
            (t (cdr s)))
        (if (p? h)
            (cons h (stream-filter p? t))
            (stream-filter p? t)))))
</pre></div>

<p>According to the tranformation proposed in [Wad98], this algorithm can
be espressed as follows in Scheme:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">(define (stream-filter p? s)
  (delay (force
          (if (null? (force s)) (delay '())
              (let ((h (car (force s)))
                    (t (cdr (force s))))
                (if (p? h)
                    (delay (cons h (stream-filter p? t)))
                    (stream-filter p? t)))))))
</pre></div>

<p>The recipe, which we will modify below, is as follows:
</p>
<ol>
<li> Wrap all constructors (e.g., <code>()</code>, <code>cons</code>) with <code>delay</code>.

</li><li> Apply <code>force</code> to arguments of deconstructors (e.g., <code>car</code>,
<code>cdr</code> and <code>null?</code>).

</li><li> Wrap procedure bodies with <code>(delay (force &hellip;))</code>.
</li></ol>

<p>However, evaluating the following with a sufficiently value for
large&ndash;number will cause a typical Scheme implementation to run out of
memory, despite the fact that the original (lazy) algorithm was
iterative, only needing tail calls to evaluate the first element of the
result stream.
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">(define (from n)
  (delay (cons n (from (+ n 1)))))

(define large-number 1000000000)

(car (force (stream-filter (lambda (n) (= n large-number))
                           (from 0))))
</pre></div>


<a name="Why-the-space-leak-occurs"></a>
<h4 class="subsubheading">Why the space leak occurs</h4>

<p>The problem occurring in the above <code>stream-filter</code> example can
already be seen in the following simple infinite loop, expressed in our
hypothetical lazy language as:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">(define (loop) (loop))
</pre></div>

<p>which becomes, according to the [Wad98] transformation:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">(define (loop) (delay (force (loop))))
</pre></div>

<p>Taking the semantics of <code>{delay, force}</code> to be informally:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">(force (delay expr)) = update promise : (delay expr)
                         with value of expr
                       return value in promise
</pre></div>

<p>we get:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">(force (loop)) = update promise1 : (delay (force (loop)))
                   with value of (force (loop))
                 return value in promise1
               = update promise1 : (delay (force (loop)))
                   with value of
                     update promise2 : (delay (force (loop)))
                       with value of (force (loop))
                     return value in promise2
                 return value in promise1
               = update promise1 : (delay (force (loop)))
                   with value of
                     update promise2 : (delay (force (loop)))
                       with value of
                          update promise3 : (delay (force (loop)))
                            with value of (force (loop))
                          return value in promise3
                     return value in promise2
                 return value in promise1
               = &hellip;
</pre></div>

<p>We see that an ever growing sequence of pending promises builds up until
the heap is exhausted.
</p>

<a name="Why-the-above-is-not-call_002d_002dby_002d_002dneed"></a>
<h4 class="subsubheading">Why the above is not call&ndash;by&ndash;need</h4>

<p>Expressing the above algorithm in terms of <code>{delay, force}</code> in
fact does not correctly capture common notions of call&ndash;by&ndash;need
evaluation semantics.  For example, in a call&ndash;by&ndash;need language with
naive graph reduction semantics, the above algorithm would run in
bounded space since naive graph reduction is known to be tail&ndash;safe.
For a good discussion of this issue, see e.g. R. Jones <em>Tail
recursion without space leaks</em> [Jon98].
</p>
<p>Our problem may be regarded as analogous to graph reduction, with
promises corresponding to graph nodes and force corresponding to
reduction.  As described by Jones, one has to be careful with the order
in which nodes are evaluated and overwritten to avoid space leaks.  In
our context this would correspond to the order in which promises are
evaluated and overwritten when forced.
</p>
<p>In the above example, naive graph reduction would correspond to the
promise at the root being overwritten at each step before the next
iteration is evaluated, thus avoiding the need for a growing sequence of
unfulfilled promises representing (unnecessary) future copy operations.
</p>

<a name="The-solution"></a>
<h4 class="subsubheading">The solution</h4>

<p>The accumulation of unnecessary promises in the above examples is a
consequence of suspensions being forced in increasingly nested contexts.
In order to correctly simulate naive graph reduction we should instead
find a way of forcing tail suspensions iteratively, each time
overwriting the previous result.
</p>
<p>A solution to this problem exists and is described (in a different
context) in <em>Compiling higher order languages into fully
tail-recursive portable C</em>, Feely et al. [Fee97].  This reference
introduces a method widely known as the trampoline technique for
evaluating tail contexts iteratively.
</p>
<p>Adapting the trampoline technique to the situation at hand, we introduce
a new primitive lazy, which behaves like an &ldquo;atomic&rdquo; <code>(delay
(force &hellip;))</code>, and which will replace the combination <code>(delay
(force &hellip;))</code> at procedure entry points.  We also redefine delay and
force as below:
</p>
<div class="smallexample">
<pre class="smallexample">; type Promise a = lazy (Promise a) | eager a

(define-syntax lazy
  (syntax-rules ()
    ((lazy exp)
     (box (cons 'lazy (lambda () exp))))))

(define (eager x)
  (box (cons 'eager x)))

(define-syntax delay
  (syntax-rules ()
    ((delay exp) (lazy (eager exp)))))

(define (force promise)
  (let ((content (unbox promise)))
    (case (car content)
      ((eager) (cdr content))
      ((lazy)  (let* ((promise* ((cdr content)))
                      (content  (unbox promise)))                      ; *
                 (if (not (eqv? (car content) 'eager))                 ; *
                     (begin (set-car! content (car (unbox promise*)))
                            (set-cdr! content (cdr (unbox promise*)))
                            (set-box! promise* content)))
                 (force promise))))))

(*) These two lines re-fetch and check the original promise in case
    the first line of the let* caused it to be forced.  For an example
    where this happens, see reentrancy test 3 below.

(define (box x) (list x))
(define unbox car)
(define set-box! set-car!)
</pre></div>

<p>Our example is then coded (see the full recipe below):
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">(define (loop) (lazy (loop)))
</pre></div>

<p>When we now evaluate <code>(force (loop))</code>, the force procedure will
execute a top&ndash;level loop which will iteratively evaluate and overwrite
subsequent suspensions.
</p>
<p>In the language of [Fee97], the iterative loop in force plays the role
of &ldquo;dispatcher&rdquo;.  The lazy form marks &ldquo;control points&rdquo; (procedure
entry and return points).  This technique is tail&ndash;safe because lazy
procedures, instead of calling other lazy procedures directly, simply
return a suspension representing a control point to be called upon the
next iteration of the dispatcher loop in force.  For more details, see
[FMRW].
