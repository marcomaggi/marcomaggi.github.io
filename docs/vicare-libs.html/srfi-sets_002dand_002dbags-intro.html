<a name="Introduction-8"></a>
<h4 class="subsection">2.37.1 Introduction</h4>


<p>Sets and bags are mutually disjoint types; they are also disjoint from
other types of Scheme objects.
</p>
<ul>
<li> Sets enforce the constraint that no two elements can be the same in the
sense of the set&rsquo;s associated equality predicate.

</li><li> Bags are like sets, but can contain the same object more than once.
However, if two elements that are the same in the sense of the equality
predicate, but not in the sense of <code>eqv?</code>, are both included, it is
not guaranteed that they will remain distinct when retrieved from the
bag: if two elements in a bag are the same in the sense of the bag&rsquo;s
comparator, the implementation may in fact store just one of them.
</li></ul>

<p>The procedures for creating and manipulating bags are the same as those
for sets, except that <code>set</code> is replaced by <code>bag</code> in their
names, and that adjoining an element to a bag is effective even if the
bag already contains the element.
</p>

<a name="Constraints"></a>
<h4 class="subsubheading">Constraints</h4>

<p>The <acronym>API</acronym> defined by <code>(srfi :113)</code> imposes usage constraints:
</p>
<ul>
<li> It is an error for any procedure to be invoked on sets or bags with
distinct comparators (in the sense of <code>eq?</code>).

</li><li> It is an error to mutate any object while it is contained in a set or
bag.

</li><li> It is an error to add an object to a set or bag which does not satisfy
the type test predicate of the comparator.

</li><li> It is an error to add or remove an object from a set or a bag while
iterating over it.
</li></ul>


<a name="Linear-update"></a>
<h4 class="subsubheading">Linear update</h4>

<p>The procedures of this <acronym>SRFI</acronym>, by default, are &ldquo;pure functional&rdquo;:
they do not alter their parameters.  However, this <acronym>SRFI</acronym> also defines
&ldquo;linear&ndash;update&rdquo; procedures, all of whose names end in <code>!</code>.  They
have hybrid pure&ndash;functional/side&ndash;effecting semantics: they are
allowed, but not required, to side&ndash;effect one of their parameters in
order to construct their result.  An implementation may legally
implement these procedures as pure, side&ndash;effect&ndash;free functions, or it
may implement them using side effects, depending upon the details of
what is the most efficient or simple to implement in terms of the
underlying representation.
</p>
<p>It is an error to rely upon these procedures working by side effect. For
example, this is not guaranteed to work:
</p>
<div class="lisp">
<pre class="lisp">(let* ((set1 (set 'a 'b 'c))           ; set1 = {a,b,c}.
       (set2 (set-adjoin! set1 'd)))   ; Add d to {a,b,c}.
  set1) ; Could be either {a,b,c} or {a,b,c,d}.
</pre></div>

<p>However, this is well&ndash;defined:
</p>
<div class="lisp">
<pre class="lisp">(let ((set1 (set 'a 'b 'c)))
  (set-adjoin! set1 'd)) ; Add d to {a,b,c}.
</pre></div>

<p>So clients of these procedures write in a functional style, but must
additionally be sure that, when the procedure is called, there are no
other live pointers to the potentially&ndash;modified character set (hence
the term &ldquo;linear update&rdquo;).
</p>
<p>There are two benefits to this convention:
</p>
<ul>
<li> Implementations are free to provide the most efficient possible
implementation, either functional or side&ndash;effecting.

</li><li> Programmers may nonetheless continue to assume that sets are purely
functional data structures: they may be reliably shared without needing
to be copied, uniquified, and so forth.
</li></ul>

<p>In practice, these procedures are most useful for efficiently
constructing sets and bags in a side&ndash;effecting manner, in some limited
local context, before passing the character set outside the local
construction scope to be used in a functional manner.
</p>
<p>Scheme provides no assistance in checking the linearity of the
potentially side&ndash;effected parameters passed to these functions: there&rsquo;s
no linear type checker or run&ndash;time mechanism for detecting violations.
</p>
<p>Note that if an implementation uses no side effects at all, it is
allowed to return existing sets and bags rather than newly allocated
ones, even where this <acronym>SRFI</acronym> explicitly says otherwise.
</p>

<a name="Comparator-restrictions"></a>
<h4 class="subsubheading">Comparator restrictions</h4>

<p>Implementations of this <acronym>SRFI</acronym> are allowed to place restrictions on the
comparators that the procedures accept.  In particular, an
implementation may require comparators to provide a comparison
procedure.  Alternatively, an implementation may require comparators to
provide a hash function, unless the equality predicate of the comparator
is <code>eq?</code>, <code>eqv?</code>, <code>equal?</code>, <code>string=?</code>, or
<code>string-ci=?</code>.  Implementations must not require the provision of
both a comparison procedure and a hash function.
