<h3 class="section">19.2 How generic functions and methods are invoked</h3>


<p>The library <code>(vicare language-extensions multimethods)</code> is
designed to work with type definitions from the library <code>(vicare)</code>
(<code>&lt;fixnum&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;string&gt;</code>, et cetera); these types and their
hierarchy are identified by unique symbols (<acronym>UID</acronym>).  For example:
</p>
<div class="lisp">
<pre class="lisp">(type-unique-identifiers &lt;string&gt;)
&rArr; (vicare:scheme-type:&lt;string&gt;
    vicare:scheme-type:&lt;top&gt;)
</pre></div>

<p>Every method has arguments specified by a tuple of type identifiers; for
example, the method definition:
</p>
<div class="lisp">
<pre class="lisp">(define-method (fluff {A &lt;string&gt;} {B &lt;struct&gt;} {C &lt;top&gt;})
  ---)
</pre></div>

<p>has arguments specified by the tuple of identifiers:
</p>
<div class="lisp">
<pre class="lisp">(&lt;string&gt; &lt;struct&gt; &lt;top&gt;)
</pre></div>

<p>Every tuple of operands to which a multimethod is applied is associated
to a tuple of type identifiers; for example, in the multimethod
application:
</p>
<div class="lisp">
<pre class="lisp">(define {B &lt;struct&gt;} ---)
(define {C &lt;top&gt;}    ---)
(fluff &quot;ciao&quot; B C)
</pre></div>

<p>the type of the operands is specified by the tuple of type identifiers:
</p>
<div class="lisp">
<pre class="lisp">(&lt;string&gt; &lt;struct&gt; &lt;top&gt;)
</pre></div>

<p>This way each tuple of method&rsquo;s arguments and each tuple of operands is
associated to a tuple of <acronym>UID</acronym>s lists.  For example, the tuple of type
identifiers:
</p>
<div class="lisp">
<pre class="lisp">(&lt;string&gt; &lt;struct&gt; &lt;top&gt;)
</pre></div>

<p>is associated to the tuple of <acronym>UID</acronym> lists:
</p>
<div class="lisp">
<pre class="lisp">((vicare:scheme-type:&lt;string&gt; vicare:scheme-type:&lt;top&gt;)
 (vicare:scheme-type:&lt;struct&gt; vicare:scheme-type:&lt;top&gt;)
 (vicare:scheme-type:&lt;top&gt;))
</pre></div>

<p>A tuple of <acronym>UID</acronym> lists is called <em>signature</em>.  Each multimethod
holds an internal collection in which every method&rsquo;s closure object is
associated to a signature.
</p>

<a name="Ordinary-multimethods"></a>
<h4 class="subsubheading">Ordinary multimethods</h4>

<p>Ordinary multimethods allow the association of a single method to a type
signature.  When an ordinary multimethod is applied to a tuple of
operands, the following happens:
</p>
<ol>
<li> For each operand a type is determined and the list of <acronym>UID</acronym>s
representing the type hierarchy is acquired.  The operands&rsquo; signature is
formed.

</li><li> The internal collection of methods is queried for all the methods
applicable to the tuple of operands, using the operands&rsquo; signature as
search key.

</li><li> The list of applicable methods is sorted from the most specific to the
least specific for the operands&rsquo; signature.  From now on the list of
sorted, applicable methods is handled as a stack.

</li><li> The next method is popped from the stack and its closure applied to the
tuple of arguments; the return value of this application becomes the
return value of the generic function application.  If the function calls
its &ldquo;next method&rdquo;: recurse to step 4 (see <a href="multimethods-next.html#multimethods-next">Invoking the next method</a>).
</li></ol>


<a name="Starred-multimethods"></a>
<h4 class="subsubheading">Starred multimethods</h4>

<p>Starred multimethods allow the definition of four qualified methods:
<code>:primary</code>, <code>:around</code>, <code>:before</code> and <code>:after</code>; we
can think of ordinary multimethods as starred generics supporting only
<code>:primary</code> methods.  The short description is that: <code>:around</code>
methods are applied first, then <code>:before</code>, <code>:primary</code> and
<code>:after</code> methods are applied in this order.
</p>
<p>For each method qualification (<code>:primary</code>, <code>:around</code>,
&hellip;): a starred multimethod holds an internal collection in which
every method&rsquo;s closure is associated to an arguments&rsquo; signature.
</p>
<p>When a starred multimethod is applied to a tuple of operands, the
following happens:
</p>
<ol>
<li> For each operand a type is determined and the list of <acronym>UID</acronym>s
representing the type hierarchy is acquired.  The operands&rsquo; signature is
formed.

</li><li> For each method qualification: the internal collection is queried for
all the methods applicable to the tuple of operands, using the operands&rsquo;
signature as search key.

</li><li> For each method qualification: the list of applicable methods is sorted
from the most specific to the least specific for the operands&rsquo;
signature.  The list of <code>:after</code> methods is reversed: from the
least specific to the most specific.
</li></ol>

<p>From now on the lists of sorted applicable methods are handled as
stacks; the stacks of <code>:primary</code>, <code>:around</code> and <code>:before</code>
methods have the most specific method on the top; the stack of
<code>:after</code> methods has the least specific method on the top.
</p>
<p>From now on the application of the multimethod enters an implicit loop
in which more methods&rsquo; closures can be applied to the same tuple of
operands.  The loop can terminate if a method&rsquo;s closure throws an
exception or, for <code>:around</code> and <code>:primary</code> methods, if it does
not take the special action of calling <code>call-next-method</code>.
</p>
<p>The loop is a bit articulated, so we may have to read the following
descriptions multiple times.  We split the description in two branches:
First a simplified invocation for multimethods having at least one
applicable <code>:primary</code> method, no <code>:around</code> methods, and
performing no calls to <code>call-next-method</code>; then the full
application algorithm.
</p>
<p>Here is the simplified branch with no <code>:around</code> methods and no
calls to <code>call-next-method</code>:
</p>
<ol start="4">
<li> Pop all the <code>:before</code> methods from the stack and apply their
closures to the tuple of operands.  The return values of these
applications are discarded.

</li><li> Pop the next <code>:primary</code> method from the stack and apply its closure
to the tuple of operands.  The return value of this application is saved
in a temporary location.

</li><li> Pop all the <code>:after</code> methods from the stack and apply their
closures to the tuple of operands.  The return values of these
applications are discarded.

</li><li> Return the saved return value of the <code>:primary</code> method.
</li></ol>

<p>here is the full application algorithm:
</p>
<ol start="4">
<li> Test if this function application originated from a call to
<code>call-next-method</code> from a <code>:before</code> or <code>:after</code> method;
if it has: raise an assertion violation.

</li><li> Test if this function application originated from a call to
<code>call-next-method</code> from a <code>:primary</code> method; if it has:

<ol>
<li> If the stack of <code>:primary</code> methods is empty raise an assertion
violation.

</li><li> Pop the next <code>:primary</code> method from the stack and apply its closure
to the tuple of operands.

</li><li> Break out returning the return value of this application: it becomes the
return value of <code>call-next-method</code>.
</li></ol>

</li><li> If the stack of <code>:primary</code> methods is empty: raise an assertion
violation.  This condition means that the multimethod has no applicable
methods for the tuple of operands.

</li><li> If the stack of <code>:around</code> methods is not empty: pop the next
<code>:around</code> method and apply its closure to the tuple of operands.
Break out returning the return value of this application.

</li><li> Pop all the <code>:before</code> methods from the stack and apply their
closures to the tuple of operands.  The return values of these
applications are discarded.

</li><li> Pop the next <code>:primary</code> method from the stack and apply its closure
to the tuple of operands.  The return value of this application is
saved in a temporary location.

</li><li> Pop all the <code>:after</code> methods from the stack and apply their
closures to the tuple of operands.  The return values of these
applications are discarded.

</li><li> Return the saved return value of the <code>:primary</code> method.
</li></ol>

<p>The <code>:primary</code> methods are meant to do the real work of the
function.  Only the most specific is applied to the operands, however
it can use <code>call-next-method</code> to invoke a least specialised version
and use its return value, and so on recursively until there are no more
next methods.
</p>
<p><code>:before</code> and <code>:after</code> methods are meant to execute additional
work before and after the primary methods; for example test pre and post
conditions on the operands.  While <code>:before</code> methods are applied
from the most specific to the least specific, <code>:after</code> methods are
applied from the least specific to the most specific.  Notice that the
<code>:after</code> methods have no access to the return value of the
<code>:primary</code> methods.
</p>
<p><code>:around</code> methods are yet another level for performing tasks before
and after the primary methods; only the most specific is applied to the
operands.  It is expected, but not mandatory, that an <code>:around</code>
method invokes <code>call-next-method</code>; when such invocations are
performed recursively: they will consume all the applicable
<code>:around</code> methods, from the most specific to the least specific,
and then will start the application of <code>:before</code>, <code>:primary</code>
and <code>:after</code> methods.
</p>
<p>The protocol of application for methods in a starred multimethod is
meant to be the same as the standard method combination for
<acronym>CLOS</acronym> methods as defined by the Common Lisp
standard<a name="DOCF4" href="#FOOT4"><sup>4</sup></a>.
