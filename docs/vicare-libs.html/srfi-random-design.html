<h4 class="subsection">2.16.5 Design rationale</h4>

<h5 class="subsubheading">Why not combine <code>random-integer</code> and <code>random-real?</code></h5>

<p>The two procedures are not combined into a single variable&ndash;arity
procedures to save a little time and space during execution.  Although
some Scheme systems can deal with variable arity as efficiently as with
fixed arity this is not always the case and time efficiency is very
important here.

<!--  -->
<h5 class="subsubheading">Why not some object&ndash;oriented interface?</h5>

<p class="noindent">There are many alternatives to the interface as specified in this
<acronym>SRFI</acronym>.  In particular, every framework for object&ndash;orientation can be
used to define a class for random sources and specify the interface for
the methods on random sources.  However, as the object&ndash;oriented
frameworks differ considerably in terms of syntax and functionality,
this <acronym>SRFI</acronym> does not make use of any particular framework.

<!--  -->
<h5 class="subsubheading">Why is there not just a generator with a fixed range?</h5>

<p class="noindent">A bare fixed&ndash;range generator is of very limited use.  Nearly every
application has to add some functionality to make use of the random
numbers.  The most fundamental task in manipulating random numbers is to
change the range and quantization.  This is exactly what is provided by
<code>random-integer</code> and <code>random-real</code>.  In addition, is saves the
user from the pitfall of changing the range with a simple
modulo-computation which may substantially reduce the quality of the
numbers being produced.

   <p>The design of the interface is based on three prototype applications:

     <ul>
<li>Repeatedly choose from relatively small sets: As the size of the set is
likely to vary from call to call, <code>random-integer</code> accepts a range
argument <var>n</var> in every call.  The implementation should try to avoid
boxing/unboxing of values if the ranges fit into immediate integers.

     <li>Generate a few large integers with a fixed number of bits: As generating
the random number itself is expensive, passing the range argument in
every call does not hurt performance.  Hence, the same interface as in
the first application can be used.

     <li>Generate real numbers: Unlike the choose&ndash;from&ndash;set case, the range and
the quantization is constant over a potentially very large number of
calls.  In addition, there are usually just a few distinct instances of
quantization and number type, most likely corresponding to underlying
<code>float</code> and <code>double</code> representations.  Therefore,
<code>random-real</code> does not accept any parameters but the procedure
<code>random-source-make-reals</code> creates a properly configured
<code>random-real</code> procedure. 
</ul>

<!--  -->
<h5 class="subsubheading">Why bother about floating point numbers at all?</h5>

<p class="noindent">A proper floating point implementation of a random number generator is
potentially much more efficient that an integer implementation because
it can use more powerful arithmetics hardware.  If in addition the
application needs floating point random numbers it would be an
intolerable waste to run an integer generator to produce floating point
random numbers.  A secondary reason is to save the user from the &ldquo;not
as easy as it seems&rdquo; task of converting an integer generator into a
real generator.

<!--  -->
<h5 class="subsubheading">Why are zero and one excluded from <code>random-real</code>?</h5>

<p class="noindent">The procedure <code>random-real</code> does not return <code>x = 0</code> or <code>x
= 1</code> in order to allow <code>(log x)</code> and <code>(log (- 1 x))</code> without
the danger of a numerical exception.
