<h5 class="subsubsection">1.19.14.2 Generators and co&ndash;routines</h5>

<p>It is possible to model generators and co&ndash;routines using streams. 
Consider the task, due to Carl Hewitt, of determining if two trees have
the same sequence of leaves:

<pre class="example">     (same-fringe? = '(1 (2 3)) '((1 2) 3))  =&gt; #t
     
     (same-fringe? = '(1 2 3) '(1 (3 2)))    =&gt; #f
</pre>
   <p>The simplest solution is to flatten both trees into lists and compare
them element&ndash;by&ndash;element:

<pre class="example">     (define (flatten tree)
       (cond [(null? tree) '()]
             [(pair? (car tree))
              (append (flatten (car tree))
                      (flatten (cdr tree)))]
             [else (cons (car tree)
                         (flatten (cdr tree)))]))
     
     (define (same-fringe? eql? tree1 tree2)
       (let loop ([t1 (flatten tree1)]
                  [t2 (flatten tree2)])
         (cond [(and (null? t1) (null? t2)) #t]
               [(or (null? t1) (null? t2)) #f]
               [(not (eql? (car t1) (car t2))) #f]
               [else (loop (cdr t1) (cdr t2))])))
</pre>
   <p>That works, but requires time to flatten both trees and space to store
the flattened versions; if the trees are large, that can be a lot of
time and space, and if the fringes differ, much of that time and space
is wasted.

   <p>Hewitt used a generator to flatten the trees one element at a time,
storing only the current elements of the trees and the machines needed
to continue flattening them, so <code>same-fringe?</code> could stop early if
the trees differ.  Dorai Sitaram presents both the generator solution
and a co&ndash;routine solution, which both involve tricky calls to
<code>call-with-current-continuation</code> and careful coding to keep them
synchronized.

   <p>An alternate solution flattens the two trees to streams instead of
lists, which accomplishes the same savings of time and space, and
involves code that looks little different than the list solution
presented above:

<pre class="example">     (define-stream (flatten tree)
       (cond [(null? tree) stream-null]
             [(pair? (car tree))
              (stream-append
                (flatten (car tree))
                (flatten (cdr tree)))]
             [else (stream-cons
                     (car tree)
                     (flatten (cdr tree)))]))
     
     (define (same-fringe? eql? tree1 tree2)
       (let loop ([t1 (flatten tree1)]
                  [t2 (flatten tree2)])
         (cond [(and (stream-null? t1)
                     (stream-null? t2)) #t]
               [(or  (stream-null? t1)
                     (stream-null? t2)) #f]
               [(not (eql? (stream-car t1)
                           (stream-car t2))) #f]
               [else (loop (stream-cdr t1)
                           (stream-cdr t2))])))
</pre>
   <p>Note that streams, a data structure, replace generators or co&ndash;routines,
which are control structures, providing a fine example of how lazy
streams enhance modularity.
