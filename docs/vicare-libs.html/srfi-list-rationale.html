<h4 class="subsection">2.2.3 Rationale</h4>


<p>The set of basic list and pair operations provided by <acronym>R4RS</acronym>/<acronym>R5RS</acronym>
Scheme is far from satisfactory.  Because this set is so small and
basic, most implementations provide additional utilities, such as a
list&ndash;filtering function, or a &ldquo;left fold&rdquo; operator, and so forth.
But, of course, this introduces incompatibilities&mdash;-different Scheme
implementations provide different sets of procedures.
</p>
<p>I have designed a full&ndash;featured library of procedures for list
processing.  While putting this library together, I checked as many
Schemes as I could get my hands on.  (I have a fair amount of experience
with several of these already.)  I missed Chez (no on&ndash;line manual that
I can find) but I hit most of the other big, full&ndash;featured Schemes.
The complete list of list&ndash;processing systems I checked is:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">R4RS/R5RS Scheme
MIT Scheme
Gambit
RScheme
MzScheme
slib
Common Lisp
Bigloo
guile
T
APL and the SML standard basis
</pre></div>

<p>As a result, the library I am proposing is fairly rich.
</p>
<p>Following this initial design phase, this library went through several
months of discussion on the <acronym>SRFI</acronym> mailing lists, and was altered in
light of the ideas and suggestions put forth during this discussion.
</p>
<p>In parallel with designing this <acronym>API</acronym>, I have also written a reference
implementation.  I have placed this source on the Net with an
unencumbered, &ldquo;open&rdquo; copyright.  A few notes about the reference
implementation:
</p>
<ul>
<li> Although I got procedure names and specs from many Schemes, I wrote this
code myself.  Thus, there are no entanglements.  Any Scheme implementor
can pick this library up with no worries about copyright problems, both
commercial and non&ndash;commercial systems.

</li><li> The code is written for portability and should be trivial to port to any
Scheme.  It has only four deviations from <acronym>R4RS</acronym>, clearly discussed in
the comments:

<ul>
<li> use of an error procedure;

</li><li> use of the <acronym>R5RS</acronym> values and a simple receive macro for producing and
consuming multiple return values;

</li><li> use of simple <code>:optional</code> and <code>let-optionals</code> macros for
optional argument parsing and defaulting;

</li><li> use of a simple <code>check-arg</code> procedure for argument checking.
</li></ul>

</li><li> It is written for clarity and well&ndash;commented.  The current source is
768 lines of source code and 826 lines of comments and white space.

</li><li> It is written for efficiency.  Fast paths are provided for common cases.
Side&ndash;effecting procedures such as <code>filter!</code> avoid unnecessary,
redundant <code>set-cdr!</code> calls which would thrash a generational
garbage&ndash;collection&rsquo;s write barrier and the store buffers of fast
processors.  Functions reuse longest common tails from input parameters
to construct their results where possible.  Constant&ndash;space iterations
are used in preference to recursions; local recursions are used in
preference to consing temporary intermediate data structures.
</li></ul>

<p>This is not to say that the implementation can&rsquo;t be tuned up for a
specific Scheme implementation.  There are notes in comments addressing
ways implementors can tune the reference implementation for performance.
</p>
<p>In short, I&rsquo;ve written the reference implementation to make it as
painless as possible for an implementor, or a regular programmer, to
adopt this library and get good results with it.
