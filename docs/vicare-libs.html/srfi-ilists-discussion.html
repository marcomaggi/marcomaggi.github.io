<h4 class="subsection">2.40.4 Discussion</h4>


<p>A set of general criteria guided the design of the <acronym>SRFI</acronym>-1 library
that underlies this library.  They are reproduced here.
</p>
<p>List&ndash;filtering procedures such as <code>ifilter</code> or <code>idelete</code> do
not disorder lists.  Elements appear in the answer list in the same
order as they appear in the argument list.  This constrains
implementation, but seems like a desirable feature, since in many uses
of lists, order matters.  (In particular, disordering an association
list is definitely a bad idea.)
</p>
<p>Contrariwise, although the sample implementations of the list&ndash;filtering
procedures share longest common tails between argument and answer lists,
it is not part of the spec.
</p>
<p>Because ilists are an inherently sequential data structure (unlike, say,
vectors), inspection procedures such as <code>ifind</code>, <code>ifind-tail</code>,
<code>ifor-each</code>, <code>iany</code> and <code>ievery</code> commit to a
left-to&ndash;right traversal order of their argument list.
</p>
<p>However, constructors, such as <code>ilist-tabulate</code> and the mapping
procedures (<code>iappend-map</code>, <code>ipair-for-each</code>,
<code>ifilter-map</code>, <code>imap-in-order</code>), do not specify the dynamic
order in which their procedural argument is applied to its various
values.
</p>
<p>Predicates return useful true values wherever possible.  Thus
<code>iany</code> must return the true value produced by its predicate, and
<code>ievery</code> returns the final true value produced by applying its
predicate argument to the last element of its argument list.
</p>
<p>No special status is accorded Scheme&rsquo;s built&ndash;in equality predicate.
Any functionality provided in terms of <code>eq?</code>, <code>eqv?</code>,
<code>equal?</code> is also available using a client&ndash;provided equality
predicate.
</p>
<p>These procedures are not generic as between ordinary pairs/lists and
immutable pairs/lists; they are specific to immutable lists.  Like Olin,
I prefer to keep the library simple and focused.  However, there are a
few conversions between mutable and immutable lists provided.
</p>

<a name="Improper-Lists-1"></a>
<h4 class="subsubheading">Improper Lists</h4>

<p>Scheme does not properly have a list type, just as C does not have a
string type.  Rather, Scheme has a binary&ndash;tuple type, from which one
can build binary trees.  There is an interpretation of Scheme values
that allows one to treat these trees as lists.  The same interpretation
is applied to immutable pairs.
</p>
<p>Because the empty list, written as &lsquo;<samp>()</samp>&rsquo;, is already immutable, it
is shared between mutable and immutable lists as the termination marker.
It is the only Scheme object that is both a mutable list and an
immutable list.
</p>
<p>Users should note that dotted lists, whether mutable or immutable, are
not commonly used, and are considered by many Scheme programmers to be
an ugly artifact of Scheme&rsquo;s lack of a true list type.  Dotted ilists
are not fully supported by this <acronym>SRFI</acronym>.  Most procedures are defined
only on proper ilists that is, &lsquo;<samp>()</samp>&rsquo;&ndash;terminated ilists.  The
procedures that will also handle dotted ilists are specifically marked.
While this design decision restricts the domain of possible arguments
one can pass to these procedures, it has the benefit of allowing the
procedures to catch the error cases where programmers inadvertently pass
scalar values to an ilist procedure by accident, e.g., by switching the
arguments to a procedure call.
