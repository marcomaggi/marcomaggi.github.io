<h3 class="section">1.1 Typed language philosophy</h3>


<p>In this document we refer to the standard Scheme language defined by the
<acronym>R6RS</acronym> specifications as the <em>standard language</em>; we refer to the
typed Scheme language defined by Vicare as the <em>typed
language</em>.
</p>
<p>To understand how Vicare represents the types of values, we
must remember that every Scheme expression might return multiple values;
so we can think of an expression evaluation as follows:
</p>
<div class="lisp">
<pre class="lisp">(call-with-values
     (lambda () <var>?epxr</var>)
  (lambda <var>?formals</var> <var>?body</var>))
</pre></div>

<p>the return values of <var>?expr</var> are bound to the <var>?formals</var> and
used in the <var>?body</var>.  For example, in the code:
</p>
<div class="lisp">
<pre class="lisp">(call-with-values
     (lambda () (values 1 2 3))
  (lambda (a b c) <var>?body</var>))
</pre></div>

<p>while the expansion of <var>?body</var> takes place: a typed language would
annotate the syntactic bindings <code>a</code>, <code>b</code> and <code>c</code> with the
information that the values are fixnums.
</p>
<p>The tuple of type annotations associated to the <var>?formals</var> is called
<em>type signature</em>; a type signature represents informations about
both the number of values and their type.  We need a type signature to
represent the types of values returned by an expression.  We need a type
signature to represent the types of the arguments accepted in a function
application.
</p>
<p>Given the <code>call-with-values</code> model of thinking to expressions
evaluations: the whole purpose of a typed language is to verify, at
expand&ndash;time, that the type signature of an expression matches the type
signature of the arguments of a function.
</p>
<p>The standard language already mandates that the operands in a function
application must be validated at run&ndash;time; this means the type
signature of the operands is matched, at run&ndash;time, with the type
signature of the arguments.  The typed language extends this feature to
make it possible at expand&ndash;time.
</p>
<p>Type annotations are not mandatory in the typed language, so some
operands are validated and others are not.
</p>
<p>To understand the role of Vicare&rsquo;s typed language extensions,
we have to consider that:
</p>
<ul>
<li> Standard Scheme is dynamically typed: language implementations might
perform application signatures validation at run&ndash;time every time a
function is called, considering that the return values of a function
application are discarded or become the arguments of another function
application.  For example the function <code>flsin</code> can be implemented
as:

<div class="example">
<pre class="example">#!r6rs
(import (except (rnrs (6))
                flsin)
  (vicare system $flonums))

(define (flsin x)
  (assert (flonum? x))
  ($flsin x))
</pre></div>

</li><li> It is possible to build a standard Scheme language implementation that
performs compile&ndash;time type inference; with such implementation:
occasionally the compiler can determine the type of operands and return
values and collapse multiple validations into a single one.  For
example:

<div class="example">
<pre class="example">#!r6rs
(import (rnrs (6)))

(define (flsomething x)
  (values (flsin x) (flcos x) (fltan x)))
</pre></div>

<p>can be transformed into (pseudo&ndash;code):
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">#!r6rs
(import (rnrs (6))
  (vicare system $flonums))

(define (flsomething x)
  (assert (flonum? x))
  (values ($flsin x) ($flcos x) ($fltan x)))
</pre></div>

<p>or automatically defined safe and unsafe variants of the same function:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">#!r6rs
(import (rnrs (6))
  (vicare system $flonums))

(define (flsomething x)
  (assert (flonum? x))
  ($flsomething x))

(define ($flsomething x)
  (values ($flsin x) ($flcos x) ($fltan x)))
</pre></div>

<p>so that the unsafe <code>$flsomething</code> can be used later in place of the
safe <code>flsomething</code> if we know that the argument is a flonum.
</p>
</li><li> The evaluation of a Scheme language program or library is defined to
have two steps: expansion; compilation&ndash;and&ndash;evaluation or
interpretation.  Standard Scheme is a &ldquo;high&ndash;level language&rdquo; which is
transformed into a &ldquo;core language&rdquo; by the process of expansion; the
expander allows macros to implement customised high&ndash;level
transformations.  The core language expressions are handed to the
compiler or the interpreter.

</li><li> Type inference does not blend well with standard Scheme macro expansion;
it is, in general, impossible to infer the types of a macro use before
fully expanding it, or, in special cases, at least partially expanding
it.  True type inference can be performed on the core language that is
the result of fully expanding the standard language.  This means we
cannot integrate the powerful features of the expander in the code
resulting from transformations made possible by type inference.

</li><li> Vicare is a language dialect whose purpose is to be a standard
Scheme language with extensions; it allows mixed use of standard
language syntax and extended language syntax.  The language extensions
are mostly implemented in the expander, to allow user code to customise
the generation of core language.

</li><li> By explicitly specifying the types of lexical bindings:
Vicare&rsquo;s dialect allows some of the expand&ndash;time validations
and transformations that would be possible in a language with full type
inference.
</li></ul>

<p>Since there is no type inference: the code writer is invited to
explicitly add type annotations to the syntaxes that establish syntactic
bindings.
