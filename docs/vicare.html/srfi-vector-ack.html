<h4 class="subsection">10.23.5 Acknowledgements</h4>

<p>Thanks to Olin Shivers for his wonderfully complete list and string
packages; to all the members of the <code>#scheme</code> <acronym>IRC</acronym> channel
on Freenode who nitpicked a great deal, but also helped quite a lot in
general, and helped test the reference implementation in various Scheme
systems; to Michael Burschik for his numerous comments; to Sergei Egorov
for helping to narrow down the procedures; to Mike Sperber for putting
up with an extremely overdue draft; to Felix Winkelmann for continually
bugging me about finishing up the <acronym>SRFI</acronym> so that it would be only
overdue and not withdrawn; and to everyone else who gave questions,
comments, thoughts, or merely attention to the <acronym>SRFI</acronym>.
