This document describes version 0.2d20 of Vicare Scheme, an
R6RS compliant native compiler for the Scheme language, producing
single threaded programs running on Intel x86 32-bit processors, with
experimental support for 64-bit machines.  _Vicare_ is pronounced
the etruscan way.

<h4 class="subsection">10.24.1 Abstract</h4>

<p>Lazy evaluation is traditionally simulated in Scheme using <code>delay</code>
and <code>force</code>.  However, these primitives are not powerful enough to
express a large class of lazy algorithms that are iterative.  Indeed, it
is folklore in the Scheme community that typical iterative lazy
algorithms written using <code>delay</code> and <code>force</code> will often
require unbounded memory.

   <p>Although various modifications of <code>delay</code> and <code>force</code> had been
proposed to resolve this problem (see e.g., the <acronym>SRFI</acronym>-40 discussion
list) they all fail some of the benchmarks provided by this <acronym>SRFI</acronym>.  To
our knowledge, the current <acronym>SRFI</acronym> provides the first exhaustive
solution to this problem.

   <p>As motivation, we first explain how the usual laziness encoding using
only <code>delay</code> and <code>force</code> will break the iterative behavior of
typical algorithms that would have been properly tail&ndash;recursive in a
true lazy language, causing the computation to require unbounded memory.

   <p>The problem is then resolved by introducing a set of three operations:

<pre class="example">     {lazy, delay, force}
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">which allow the programmer to succinctly express lazy algorithms while
retaining bounded space behavior in cases that are properly
tail&ndash;recursive.  A general recipe for using these primitives is
provided.  An additional procedure <code>eager</code> is provided for the
construction of eager promises in cases where efficiency is a concern.

   <p>Although this <acronym>SRFI</acronym> redefines <code>delay</code> and <code>force</code>, the
extension is conservative in the sense that the semantics of the subset
<code>{delay, force}</code> in isolation (i.e., as long as the program does
not use <code>lazy</code>) agrees with that in <acronym>R5RS</acronym>.  In other words, no
program that uses the <acronym>R5RS</acronym> definitions of <code>delay</code> and
<code>force</code> will break if those definition are replaced by the
<acronym>SRFI</acronym>-45 definitions of <code>delay</code> and <code>force</code>.
