This document describes version 0.3d1 of Vicare Scheme, an
R6RS compliant native compiler for the Scheme language, producing
single threaded programs running on Intel x86 32-bit processors, with
experimental support for 64-bit machines.  _Vicare_ is pronounced
the etruscan way.

<h4 class="subsection">14.28.7 Related work</h4>

<p>The use of compare procedures is not new; defining control structures
(<code>if3</code>, <code>select-compare</code> etc.) for dealing with them
efficiently, however, seems to be new (at least we have not seen it
before).

   <p>Total ordering in <acronym>R5RS</acronym> is represented by typed order predicates,
such as <code>&lt;=</code>, <code>char&lt;=?</code> etc.  Although a &ldquo;less or
equal&rdquo;-predicate is sufficient to define a total order, <acronym>R5RS</acronym>
defines a complete set of compare predicates (that is <code>=</code> ,
<code>&lt;</code>, <code>&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;</code>, and &lt;) for the sake of convenience and
readability.  There are 25 procedures related to total orders in
<acronym>R5RS</acronym>.

   <p>The traditional approach in Scheme to equivalence (&ldquo;Are two values
treated as equal?&rdquo;) is the fixed set of predicates <code>eq?</code>,
<code>eqv?</code>, and <code>equal?</code>. Historically, this approach was
motivated by the desire to compare only pointers and avoid structural
recursion.  This <acronym>SRFI</acronym> provides the generalization to arbitrary
equivalence relations, provided the equivalence classes are totally
ordered.

   <p>The Ruby programming language [4] provides a method <code>&lt;=&gt;</code> which is
a compare procedure in the sense of this <acronym>SRFI</acronym>.  By (re-)defining this
method a total order can be defined for the instances of a class, when
compared against other objects.  All 2-way comparisons are based on
<code>&lt;=&gt;</code>, but in Ruby essentially every method can be overloaded.

   <p>In the Haskell 98 programming language [6] order predicates and compare
functions coexist.  The type Ordering [6, Sect 6.1.8] is an enumeration
of the three symbolic constants <code>LT</code>, <code>EQ</code>, <code>GT</code>.  The
type class <code>Ord</code> [6, Sect 6.3.2] asserts the presence of a total
order for a type, provided the type class <code>Eq</code> [6, Sect 6.3.1] also
asserts the presence of an equivalence.  Since the default definition of
the method compare is in terms of the methods <code>==</code> and <code>&lt;=</code>,
and vice versa, it can be chosen easily how to provide the total order
without affecting its pattern of use.

   <p>The C function <code>strcmp()</code> [7] of the <samp><span class="file">string.h</span></samp>&ndash;library acts
as a compare procedure in the sense of this <acronym>SRFI</acronym>, although it is
specified to return an integer of which only the sign matters.  Python
[5] has a built in function <code>cmp</code> which is a compare procedure in
the sense of this <acronym>SRFI</acronym>.

   <p>In <acronym>SRFI</acronym>-32 (Sort libraries) [13] the total orders used for sorting
are represented by a &ldquo;less than&rdquo; procedure.  The discussion archive
[13] contains a short discussion thread on the use of 3-value
comparisons under the aspect whether they can be used to improve the
sorting algorithm itself.

   <p>In the <code>Galore.plt</code> library of data structures for PLT Scheme,
total orders are represented by the signature definition
<code>(define-signature order^ (elm= elm&lt; elm&lt;=))</code>.
