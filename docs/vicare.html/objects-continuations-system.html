R6RS compliant native compiler for the Scheme language, producing
single threaded programs running on Intel x86 32-bit processors, with
experimental support for 64-bit machines.  _Vicare_ is pronounced
the etruscan way.

<h4 class="subsection">17.25.3 System continuation objects</h4>

<p>Vicare is written in both the C language and the Scheme
language; the runtime system performing heap and stack memory allocation
and garbage collection is written in the C language.  Vicare
starts with C code and enters Scheme code when running a Scheme program:

<pre class="example">     C code --&gt; Scheme code
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">when the last Scheme function returns: Vicare knowns that it
has to return to C code because the Scheme stack is initialised with a
return address to a special routine (the underflow handler) that does
it.

   <p>It is clear that, while running a Scheme program, every now and then
Vicare must switch between portions of code written in C and
portions of code written in Scheme; such portions make different use of
the <acronym>CPU</acronym>.

   <p>Whenever Vicare leaves C code execution to enter Scheme code
execution: it saves the current state of the C stack; in practice it
saves the pointer to the top of the stack in the <acronym>PCB</acronym> structure. 
Whenever Vicare leaves Scheme code execution to return to C
code execution: it saves the current state of the Scheme stack in the
<acronym>PCB</acronym> and restores the state of the C stack from the <acronym>PCB</acronym>.

   <p>While running Scheme code we can call a C function through the
primitive, low&ndash;level operation <code>foreign-call</code> (when using the
<acronym>FFI</acronym> callout mechanism we are still using <code>foreign-call</code>):

<pre class="example">     C code --&gt; Scheme code (--&gt; foreign-call) --&gt; C code
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">when leaving Scheme code: the status of the Scheme stack is saved in the
<acronym>PCB</acronym>; the C stack creates no problems: we just retrieve the top of the
C stack from the <acronym>PCB</acronym> and use the stack region below it,

        C stack before entering     C stack after
        Scheme code                 reentering C code
</pre>
   <p><strong class="float-caption">Figure 17.5: The C stack portions used before entering Scheme code and after
reentering C code with <code>foreign-call</code>.</strong></p></div>

   <p>Now let's say that, after entering nested C code, we enter nested Scheme
code:

<pre class="example">     C code 1 --&gt; Scheme code 1 --&gt; C code 2 --&gt; Scheme code 2
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">at the transition from <code>C code 2</code> to <code>Scheme code 2</code> we must
save the state of the C stack, but the dedicated fields in the <acronym>PCB</acronym>
are already busy with the status of <code>C code 1</code>.  Vicare
solves this problem with continuation objects; at the transition from
<code>C code 2</code> to <code>Scheme code 2</code>:

     <ol type=1 start=1>
<li>A Scheme continuation object is created to hold the status of
<code>Scheme code 1</code> previously saved in the <acronym>PCB</acronym>.

     <li>A system continuation object is created to hold the status of <code>C
code 1</code> previously saved in the <acronym>PCB</acronym>.

     <li>The status of <code>C code 2</code> is saved in the <acronym>PCB</acronym>.

     <li>Execution of <code>Scheme code 2</code> is entered in a clean Scheme stack
segment.
        </ol>

<p class="noindent">whenever <code>Scheme code 2</code> goes back to <code>C code 2</code>:

     <ol type=1 start=1>
<li>The Scheme stack segment used by <code>Scheme code 2</code> is abandoned.

     <li>The status of <code>C code 2</code> is restored from the system continuation
object.

     <li>The execution enters <code>C code 2</code>.

     <li>The status of <code>Scheme code 1</code> is restored from the Scheme
continuation object.

     <li>The execution enters <code>Scheme code 1</code>.
        </ol>

   <p>In a system continuation object:

     <ul>
<li>The field <code>top</code> is an untagged memory pointer referencing the C
language stack last saved upon exiting C code and entering Scheme code;
it is the content of the field <code>pcb-&gt;system_stack</code> at the time this
system continuation object was created.

     <li>The field <code>size</code> of a system continuation object is unused. 
</ul>

   <p>Upon creation, both Scheme and system continuation objects are prepended
to the linked list referenced by the field <code>next_k</code> of the <acronym>PCB</acronym>
structure.
