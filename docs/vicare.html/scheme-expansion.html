<h3 class="section">3.10 Expansion process</h3>

<p>Macro uses are expanded into <dfn>core forms</dfn> at the start of evaluation
(before compilation or interpretation) by a syntax <dfn>expander</dfn>.  The
set of core forms is implementation&ndash;dependent, as is the representation
of these forms in the expander's output.

     <ul>
<li>If the expander encounters a syntactic abstraction, it invokes the
associated transformer to expand the syntactic abstraction, then repeats
the expansion process for the form returned by the transformer.

     <li>If the expander encounters a core form, it recursively processes its
subforms that are in expression or definition context, if any, and
reconstructs the form from the expanded subforms. 
</ul>

   <p>Information about identifier bindings is maintained during expansion to
enforce lexical scoping for variables and keywords.

   <p>To handle definitions, the expander processes the initial forms in a
<var>?body</var> or <var>?library-body</var> from left to right.  How the expander
processes each form encountered depends upon the kind of form.

     <dl>
<dt>macro use<dd>The expander invokes the associated transformer to transform the macro
use, then recursively performs whichever of these actions are
appropriate for the resulting form.

     <br><dt><code>define-syntax</code> form<dd>The expander expands and evaluates the right&ndash;hand&ndash;side expression and
binds the keyword to the resulting transformer.

     <br><dt><code>define</code> form<dd>The expander records the fact that the defined identifier is a variable
but defers expansion of the right&ndash;hand&ndash;side expression until after all
of the definitions have been processed.

     <br><dt><code>begin</code> form<dd>The expander splices the subforms into the list of body forms it is
processing.

     <br><dt><code>let-syntax</code> or <code>letrec-syntax</code> form<dd>The expander splices the inner body forms into the list of (outer) body
forms it is processing, arranging for the keywords bound by the
<code>let-syntax</code> and <code>letrec-syntax</code> to be visible only in the
inner body forms.

     <br><dt>expression, i.e., nondefinition<dd>The expander completes the expansion of the deferred right&ndash;hand&ndash;side
expressions and the current and remaining expressions in the body, and
then creates the equivalent of a <code>letrec*</code> form from the defined
variables, expanded right&ndash;hand&ndash;side expressions, and expanded body
expressions. 
</dl>

   <p>For the right&ndash;hand side of the definition of a variable, expansion is
deferred until after all of the definitions have been seen. 
Consequently, each keyword and variable reference within the right&ndash;hand
side resolves to the local binding, if any.

   <p>A definition in the sequence of forms must not define any identifier
whose binding is used to determine the meaning of the undeferred
portions of the definition or any definition that precedes it in the
sequence of forms.  For example, the bodies of the following expressions
violate this restriction.

<pre class="example">     (let ()
       (define define 17)
       (list define))
     
     (let-syntax ((def0 (syntax-rules ()
                          ((_ x) (define x 0)))))
       (let ((z 3))
         (def0 z)
         (define def0 list)
         (list z)))
     
     (let ()
       (define-syntax foo
         (lambda (e)
           (+ 1 2)))
       (define + 2)
       (foo))
</pre>
   <p>The following do not violate the restriction.

<pre class="example">     (let ((x 5))
       (define lambda list)
       (lambda x x))         &rArr;  (5 5)
     
     (let-syntax ((def0 (syntax-rules ()
                          ((_ x) (define x 0)))))
       (let ((z 3))
         (define def0 list)
         (def0 z)
         (list z)))          &rArr;  (3)
     
     (let ()
       (define-syntax foo
         (lambda (e)
           (let ((+ -)) (+ 1 2))))
       (define + 2)
       (foo))                &rArr;  -1
</pre>
   <p>The implementation should treat a violation of the restriction as a
syntax violation.

   <p>Note that this algorithm does not directly reprocess any form.  It
requires a single left&ndash;to&ndash;right pass over the definitions followed by
a single pass (in any order) over the body expressions and deferred
right&ndash;hand sides.

   <p>Example:

<pre class="example">     (lambda (x)
       (define-syntax defun
         (syntax-rules ()
           ((_ x a e) (define x (lambda a e)))))
       (defun even? (n) (or (= n 0) (odd? (- n 1))))
       (define-syntax odd?
         (syntax-rules () ((_ n) (not (even? n)))))
       (odd? (if (odd? x) (* x x) x)))
</pre>
   <p>In the example:

     <ol type=1 start=1>
<li>The definition of <code>defun</code> is encountered first, and the keyword
<code>defun</code> is associated with the transformer resulting from the
expansion and evaluation of the corresponding right&ndash;hand side.

     <li>A use of <code>defun</code> is encountered next and expands into a
<code>define</code> form.  Expansion of the right&ndash;hand side of this
<code>define</code> form is deferred.

     <li>The definition of <code>odd?</code> is next and results in the association of
the keyword <code>odd?</code> with the transformer resulting from expanding
and evaluating the corresponding right&ndash;hand side.

     <li>A use of <code>odd?</code>  appears next and is expanded; the resulting call
to <code>not</code> is recognized as an expression because <code>not</code> is bound
as a variable.

     <li>At this point, the expander completes the expansion of the current
expression (the call to <code>not</code>) and the deferred right&ndash;hand side of
the <code>even?</code>  definition; the uses of <code>odd?</code> appearing in these
expressions are expanded using the transformer associated with the
keyword <code>odd?</code>.

     <li>The final output is the equivalent of:

     <pre class="example">          (lambda (x)
            (letrec* ((even? (lambda (n)
                               (or (= n 0)
                                   (not (even? (- n 1)))))))
              (not (even? (if (not (even? x))
                              (* x x)
                            x)))))
</pre>
     <p class="noindent">although the structure of the output is implementation-dependent.
        </ol>

   <p>Because definitions and expressions can be interleaved in a
<var>?top-level-body</var>, the expander's processing of a
<var>?top-level-body</var> is somewhat more complicated.  It behaves as
described above for a <var>?body</var> or <var>?library-body</var> with the
following exceptions:

     <ul>
<li>When the expander finds a nondefinition, it defers its expansion and
continues scanning for definitions.

     <li>Once it reaches the end of the set of forms, it processes the deferred
right&ndash;hand&ndash;side and body expressions, then generates the equivalent of
a <code>letrec*</code> form from the defined variables, expanded
right&ndash;hand&ndash;side expressions, and expanded body expressions.

     <li>For each body expression <var>?expression</var> that appears before a
variable definition in the body, a dummy binding is created at the
corresponding place within the set of <code>letrec*</code> bindings, with a
fresh temporary variable on the left&ndash;hand side and the equivalent of:

     <pre class="example">          (begin <var>?expression</var> <var>?unspecified</var>)
</pre>
     <p class="noindent">where <var>?unspecified</var> is a side&ndash;effect&ndash;free expression returning an
unspecified value, on the right&ndash;hand side, so that left&ndash;to&ndash;right
evaluation order is preserved.  The <code>begin</code> wrapper allows
<var>?expression</var> to evaluate to an arbitrary number of values. 
</ul>
