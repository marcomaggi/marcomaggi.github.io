R6RS compliant native compiler for the Scheme language, producing
single threaded programs running on Intel x86 32-bit processors, with
experimental support for 64-bit machines.  _Vicare_ is pronounced
the etruscan way.

<h4 class="subsection">14.23.1 Memory layout of code objects</h4>

<p>A code object is a fixed length memory block, of variable size equal to
a multiple of the host's page size, referenced by machine words tagged
as vectors; the memory is allocated with <code>mmap()</code> and is given read,
write and execution protection.  The memory layout of a code object is
as follows:

<pre class="example">          page size          page size          page size
     |..................|..................|..................|
     |-----------|-----------------------------------|++++++++|
       meta data                 data area             unused
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">if the requested memory is less than the exact multiple of a page size,
the last allocated bytes are unused and set to zero at allocation time.

   <p>The first machine word of a code memory block is tagged has code in its
least significant bits and it has the most significant bits set to zero.

<pre class="example">     |------------------------|-------------| reference to code
         memory pointer         vector tag
     
     |------------------------|-------------| code first word
        all set to zero          code tag
</pre>
   <!--  -->
<h5 class="subsubheading">Meta data in a code memory block</h5>

<p>The first words of a code memory block hold meta data:

     <ol type=1 start=1>
<li>The first word contains the secondary tag needed to recognise a Scheme
object as code object.

     <li>The second word contains a non&ndash;negative fixnum representing the number
of used bytes in the allocated block; this is <strong>not</strong> the number of
allocated bytes (multiple of the page size), just the number of bytes
actually used by meta data and binary code.

     <li>The third word contains the reference to a Scheme vector used as
relocation vector.

     <li>The fourth word contains a non&ndash;negative fixnum representing the number
of free variables in the contained code.  If such values is zero: the
code is a thunk.

     <li>The fifth word contains a code annotation; it is initialised to
<code>#f</code>.

     <li>The sixth word is currently unused; it is initialised to the fixnum
zero.
        </ol>

<p class="noindent">the subsequent words in the memory block are the code object's data
area.
