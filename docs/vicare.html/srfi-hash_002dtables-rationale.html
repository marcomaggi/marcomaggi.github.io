This document describes version 0.2d20 of Vicare Scheme, an
R6RS compliant native compiler for the Scheme language, producing
single threaded programs running on Intel x86 32-bit processors, with
experimental support for 64-bit machines.  _Vicare_ is pronounced
the etruscan way.

<h4 class="subsection">10.29.3 Rationale</h4>

<p>Hash tables are widely recognised as a fundamental data structure for
many kinds of computational tasks.  Thus far, there is no existing
standard for Scheme hash tables; however, almost every non&ndash;minimal
Scheme implementation provides some kind of hash table functionality.

   <p>Alas, although somewhat similar, these hash table <acronym>API</acronym>s have many
differences: some trivial, like the naming of certain functions; some
complex, like revealing different aspects of the internal implementation
to the user; some coarse, like requiring keys to be of some specific
type(s); some subtle, like requiring the user to guess the size of the
hash table in advance to get optimal performance.  As a result, the
existing hash table facilities cannot be used to write portable
programs.

   <p>The primary aim of this <acronym>SRFI</acronym> is to establish a standard <acronym>API</acronym> for
hash tables so that portable programs can be written that make efficient
use of common hash table functionality.  The <acronym>SRFI</acronym> resolves
discrepancies that exist between the various hash table <acronym>API</acronym>'s with
respect to naming and semantics of hash table operations.  A lot of
effort has been put into making the the API consistent, simple and
generic.  The <acronym>SRFI</acronym> also defines some of the most common utility
routines that would otherwise need to be written and rewritten for
various applications.

   <p>Incorporating this <acronym>SRFI</acronym> as a standard feature in Scheme
implementations makes it possible to write efficient and portable
programs that use hash tables.
