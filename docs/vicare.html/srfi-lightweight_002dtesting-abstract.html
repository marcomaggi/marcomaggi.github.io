R6RS compliant native compiler for the Scheme language, producing
single threaded programs running on Intel x86 32-bit processors, with
experimental support for 64-bit machines.  _Vicare_ is pronounced
the etruscan way.

<h4 class="subsection">11.30.2 Abstract</h4>

<p>A simple mechanism is defined for testing Scheme programs.  As a most
primitive example, the expression:

<pre class="example">     (check (+ 1 1) =&gt; 3)
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">evaluates the expression <code>(+ 1 1)</code> and compares the result with the
expected result <code>3</code> provided after the syntactic keyword <code>=&gt;</code>. 
Then the outcome of this comparison is reported in human&ndash;readable form
by printing a message of the form:

<pre class="example">     (+ 1 1) =&gt; 2 ; *** failed ***
     ; expected result: 3
</pre>
   <p>Moreover, the outcome of any executed check is recorded in a global
state counting the number of correct and failed checks and storing the
first failed check.  At the end of a file, or at any other point, the
user can print a summary using <code>check-report</code>.

   <p>In addition to the simple test above, it is also possible to execute a
parametric sequence of checks.  Syntactically, this takes the form of an
eager comprehension in the sense of <acronym>SRFI</acronym>-42.  For example:

<pre class="example">     (check-ec (:range e 100)
               (:let x (expt 2.0 e))
       (= (+ x 1) x) =&gt; #f (e x))
</pre>
   <p>This statement runs the variable e through <code>{0..99}</code> and for each
binding defines <var>x</var> as <code>(expt 2.0 e)</code>.  Then it is checked if
<code>(+ x 1)</code> is equal to <var>x</var>, and it is expected that this is not
the case (i.e. expected value is <code>#f</code>).  The trailing <code>(e x)</code>
tells the reporting mechanism to print the values of both <var>e</var> and
<var>x</var> in case of a failed check.  The output could look like this:

<pre class="example">     (let ((e 53) (x 9007199254740992.0)) (= (+ x 1) x)) =&gt; #t ; *** failed ***
     ; expected result: #f
</pre>
   <p>The specification of bindings to report, <code>(e x)</code> in the example, is
optional but very informative.  Other features of this <acronym>SRFI</acronym> are:

     <ul>
<li>a way to specify a different equality predicate (default is
<code>equal?</code>);

     <li>controlling the amount of reporting being printed;

     <li>switching off the execution and reporting of checks entriely;

     <li>retrieving a boolean if all checks have been executed and passed. 
</ul>
