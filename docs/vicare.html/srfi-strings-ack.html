<h4 class="subsection">10.8.4 Acknowledgments</h4>

<p>The design of this library benefited greatly from the feedback provided
during the <acronym>SRFI</acronym> discussion phase.  Among those contributing
thoughtful commentary and suggestions, both on the mailing list and by
private discussion, were Paolo Amoroso, Lars Arvestad, Alan Bawden, Jim
Bender, Dan Bornstein, Per Bothner, Will Clinger, Brian Denheyer, Mikael
Djurfeldt, Kent Dybvig, Sergei Egorov, Marc Feeley, Matthias Felleisen,
Will Fitzgerald, Matthew Flatt, Arthur A. Gleckler, Ben Goetter, Sven
Hartrumpf, Erik Hilsdale, Richard Kelsey, Oleg Kiselyov, Bengt Kleberg,
Donovan Kolbly, Bruce Korb, Shriram Krishnamurthi, Bruce Lewis, Tom
Lord, Brad Lucier, Dave Mason, David Rush, Klaus Schilling, Jonathan
Sobel, Mike Sperber, Mikael Staldal, Vladimir Tsyshevsky, Donald Welsh,
and Mike Wilson.  I am grateful to them for their assistance.

   <p>I am also grateful the authors, implementors and documentors of all the
systems mentioned in the introduction.  Aubrey Jaffer and Kent Pitman
should be noted for their work in producing Web&ndash;accessible versions of
the <acronym>R5RS</acronym> and Common Lisp spec, which was a tremendous aid.

   <p>This is not to imply that these individuals necessarily endorse the
final results, of course.

   <p>During this document's long development period, great patience was
exhibited by Mike Sperber, who is the editor for the <acronym>SRFI</acronym>, and by
Hillary Sullivan, who is not.
