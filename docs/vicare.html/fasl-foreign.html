R6RS compliant native compiler for the Scheme language producing
single threaded programs running on Intel x86 32-bit processors, with
experimental support for 64-bit machines.  _Vicare_ is pronounced
the etruscan way.

<h3 class="appendixsec">E.3 Associating foreign libraries to <acronym>FASL</acronym> files</h3>

<p><a name="index-g_t_0040func_007bforeign_002dcall_007d-1721"></a>

   <p>The macro <code>foreign-call</code>, exported by the libraries
<code>(ikarus)</code> and <code>(vicare)</code>, is expanded to compiled code
which invokes a C function from the process image; the first argument to
<code>foreign-call</code> is a string naming the C function.  Whenever the
code is compiled, the C pointer to the named function is retrieved with
a call to:

<pre class="example">     dlsym(RTLD_DEFAULT, function_name);
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">so all the public functions from the running <samp><span class="command">vicare</span></samp> executable
are available and also all the functions from host's shared libraries
loaded with <code>dlopen()</code> using the flags <code>RTLD_NOW |
RTLD_GLOBAL</code>.

   <p>It is possible to associate one or more host's shared libraries to a
<acronym>FASL</acronym> file, so that: whenever the <acronym>FASL</acronym> file is loaded, the shared
library is loaded too and the functions required by <code>foreign-call</code>
are available.  This is especially useful to implement bindings to
foreign libraries without relying on the <acronym>FFI</acronym> and making full use of
garbage collection facilities and access to Scheme values' memory
representations.

   <blockquote>
<strong>NOTE</strong> The mechanism described below is a temporary
implementation which may change in the future. 
</blockquote>

   <p>Whenever Vicare's source code reader, in <code>#!vicare</code> mode,
finds a form like:

<pre class="example">     #!(load-shared-library "vicarecre2")
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">it handles it as a special comment which causes no code to be expanded
nor compiled.  Rather a foreign shared library whose identifier is
<code>vicarecre2</code> is immediately loaded.

   <p>If the library file containing such special comment is compiled to a
<acronym>FASL</acronym> file, an object field with header <code>O</code> is written to the
<strong>beginning</strong> of the <acronym>FASL</acronym> file: such object will cause the
foreign library to be loaded whenever the <acronym>FASL</acronym> file is loaded.

   <p>On Unix&ndash;like systems: the library identifier is prefixed with
<code>lib</code> and suffixed with <code>.so</code> to compose a library file name.
