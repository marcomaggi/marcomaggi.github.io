This document describes version 0.2d20 of Vicare Scheme, an
R6RS compliant native compiler for the Scheme language, producing
single threaded programs running on Intel x86 32-bit processors, with
experimental support for 64-bit machines.  _Vicare_ is pronounced
the etruscan way.

<h4 class="subsection">10.12.3 Rationale</h4>

<p><acronym>R5RS</acronym> Scheme requires certain operations to signal an error when they
fail.  &ldquo;Signalling an error&rdquo; means that implementations must detect
and report the error.  Moreover, <acronym>R5RS</acronym> encourages, but not requires,
implementations to signal an error in many more circumstances.

   <p>However, there is no direct way for the Scheme application programmer to
report an error that occured in his or her own application.  This means
that Scheme procedures created by applications or libraries are in this
respect not on equal footing with procedures provided by the Scheme
system.

   <p>Many Scheme systems already provide a mechanism that allows application
code to report an error.  At least the following implementations support
such a mechanism: Bigloo, Guile, <acronym>MIT</acronym> Scheme, <acronym>PLT</acronym>
Scheme, RScheme, Scsh, SCM, all implementations supported by Slib.  Of
these implementations, the following have an error mechanism compatible
with this <acronym>SRFI</acronym>: Guile, <acronym>MIT</acronym> Scheme, <acronym>PLT</acronym> Scheme,
RScheme, Scsh.  The implementation in Slib has a different name than the
one proposed in this <acronym>SRFI</acronym>.

   <p>To summarise, many implementations already have the error reporting
mechanism described in this <acronym>SRFI</acronym> and others are easily made
compatible with this <acronym>SRFI</acronym>.  This shows that the proposed mechanism
is considered useful and that it is easy to implement in most major
implementations.
