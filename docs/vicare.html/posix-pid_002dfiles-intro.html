This document describes version 0.3d1 of Vicare Scheme, an
R6RS compliant native compiler for the Scheme language, producing
single threaded programs running on Intel x86 32-bit processors, with
experimental support for 64-bit machines.  _Vicare_ is pronounced
the etruscan way.

<h4 class="subsection">8.28.1 Introduction to <acronym>PID</acronym> files</h4>

<p>A <acronym>PID</acronym> file is a textual file in <acronym>ASCII</acronym> encoding created at
process start time and deleted at process exit time; it contains a
string representing the <acronym>PID</acronym> number of the current process
followed by a newline character.

   <p>The <acronym>PID</acronym> file is especially useful whenever a server is
executed as daemon: it allows for quick retrieval of the <acronym>PID</acronym>
number, which can be used to send interprocess signals to the daemon;
for example: to shut it down, to restart it, to update its
configuration.

   <p>When a <acronym>PID</acronym> file is used: the creator process should refuse to
start if the <acronym>PID</acronym> file already exists, because it may mean that
a program instance is already in execution.

   <p>The <acronym>PID</acronym> file must be created after a server daemonisation
process has completed: this way we correctly store the <acronym>PID</acronym> of
the daemon process, rather than the <acronym>PID</acronym> of the starting
process.

   <p>The <acronym>PID</acronym> file must be created after a process has changed its
user and group IDs to drop special privileges: this way the file is
created with appropriate owner and group.

   <p>All the operations performed by this library are logged.  Logging
operations related to the <acronym>PID</acronym> file rely on the function
referenced by an internal parameter; we just need to configure this
parameter with an appropriate function.
