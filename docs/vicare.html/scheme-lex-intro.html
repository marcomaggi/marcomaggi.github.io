This document describes version 0.3d1 of Vicare Scheme, an
R6RS compliant native compiler for the Scheme language, producing
single threaded programs running on Intel x86 32-bit processors, with
experimental support for 64-bit machines.  _Vicare_ is pronounced
the etruscan way.

<h4 class="subsection">3.4.1 Introduction</h4>

<p>The syntax of Scheme code is organized in three levels:

     <ol type=1 start=1>
<li>The <dfn>lexical syntax</dfn> that describes how a program text is split
into a sequence of lexemes.

     <li>The <dfn>datum syntax</dfn>, formulated in terms of the lexical syntax, that
structures the lexeme sequence as a sequence of <dfn>syntactic data</dfn>,
where a syntactic datum is a recursively structured entity.

     <li>The <dfn>program syntax</dfn> formulated in terms of the datum syntax,
imposing further structure and assigning meaning to syntactic data.
        </ol>

   <p>Syntactic data (also called <dfn>external representations</dfn>) double as a
notation for objects, and Scheme's <code>(rnrs io ports (6))</code> library
provides the <code>get-datum</code> and <code>put-datum</code> procedures for
reading and writing syntactic data, converting between their textual
representation and the corresponding objects.  <a href="stdlib-io-port.html#stdlib-io-port">Port input/output</a>.  Each syntactic datum represents a corresponding
<em>datum value</em>.  A syntactic datum can be used in a program to
obtain the corresponding datum value using <code>quote</code>.  <a href="baselib-expressions-quotation.html#baselib-expressions-quotation">Quotation</a>

   <p>Scheme source code consists of syntactic data and (non&ndash;significant)
comments.  Syntactic data in Scheme source code are called <em>forms</em>. 
(A form nested inside another form is called a <em>subform</em>.) 
Consequently, Scheme's syntax has the property that any sequence of
characters that is a form is also a syntactic datum representing some
object.  This can lead to confusion, since it may not be obvious out of
context whether a given sequence of characters is intended to be a
representation of objects or the text of a program.  It is also a source
of power, since it facilitates writing programs such as interpreters or
compilers that treat programs as objects (or vice versa).

   <p>A datum value may have several different external representations.  For
example, both <code>#e28.000</code> and <code>#x1c</code> are syntactic data
representing the exact integer object 28, and the syntactic data
<code>(8 13)</code>, <code>( 08 13 )</code>, <code>(8 . (13 . ()))</code> all represent a
list containing the exact integer objects 8 and 13.  Syntactic data that
represent equal objects (in the sense of <code>equal?</code>; <a href="baselib-predicates.html#baselib-predicates">baselib predicates</a>) are always equivalent as forms of a program.

   <p>Because of the close correspondence between syntactic data and datum
values, this report sometimes uses the term <em>datum</em> for either a
syntactic datum or a datum value when the exact meaning is apparent from
the context.

   <p>An implementation must not extend the lexical or datum syntax in any
way, with one exception: it need not treat the syntax
<code>#!&lt;identifier&gt;</code>, for any &lt;identifier&gt; (<a href="scheme-lex-syntax-identifiers.html#scheme-lex-syntax-identifiers">scheme lex syntax identifiers</a>) that is not <code>r6rs</code>, as a syntax violation, and it may
use specific <code>#!</code>&ndash;prefixed identifiers as flags indicating that
subsequent input contains extensions to the standard lexical or datum
syntax.  The syntax <code>#!r6rs</code> may be used to signify that the input
afterward is written with the lexical syntax and datum syntax described
by this report.  <code>#!r6rs</code> is otherwise treated as a comment;
