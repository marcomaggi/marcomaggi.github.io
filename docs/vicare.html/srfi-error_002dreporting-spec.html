This document describes version 0.2d20 of Vicare Scheme, an
R6RS compliant native compiler for the Scheme language, producing
single threaded programs running on Intel x86 32-bit processors, with
experimental support for 64-bit machines.  _Vicare_ is pronounced
the etruscan way.

<h4 class="subsection">10.12.4 Specification</h4>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: <b>error</b><var> reason </var>[<var>arg1 </var>[<var>arg2 ...</var>]])<var><a name="index-error-3098"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>The argument <var>reason</var> should be a string.  The procedure error will
signal an error, as described in <acronym>R5RS</acronym>, and it will report the
message <var>reason</var> and the objects <var>arg1</var>, <var>arg2</var>, ...

        <p>What exactly constitutes &ldquo;signalling&rdquo; and &ldquo;reporting&rdquo; is not
prescribed, because of the large variation in Scheme systems.  So it is
left to the implementor to do something reasonable.  To that end, a few
examples of possible behaviour are given.

          <ol type=1 start=1>
<li>Display <var>reason</var> and <var>arg1</var>... on the screen and terminate the
Scheme program.  This might be suitable for a Scheme system implemented
as a batch compiler.

          <li>Display <var>reason</var> and <var>arg1</var>... on the screen and go back to the
read&ndash;evaluate&ndash;print loop.  This might be suitable for an interactive
implementation.

          <li>In the case of a multi&ndash;threaded system: terminate the current thread,
but do not terminate the other threads.  Possibly make the arguments to
error available to other threads in some way.  See the
<code>thread-join!</code>  mechanism in <acronym>SRFI</acronym>-18 on how this could be done.

          <li>Package <var>reason</var> and <var>arg1</var>... up into an error object and pass
this error object to an exception handler.  The default exception
handler then might do something as described in points 1 to 3.

          <li>In the case of a Scheme system that runs completely unattended and that
has no way to notify a human, the only reasonable course of action might
be to do nothing at all.  However, this should be considered a last
resort.  Clearly, if all implementors would choose this strategy, this
<acronym>SRFI</acronym> would not be very useful.
             </ol>

        <p>An implementation might report more information than just <var>reason</var>
and <var>arg1</var>...  For instance, it might report the procedure name in
which the error occured or even print a stack trace.  However, this will
require additional support in the Scheme implementation.

<h5 class="subsubheading">Why error is a procedure</h5>

<p class="noindent">It is conceivable to allow error to be a special form, such as a macro,
rather than a procedure.  This might make providing information such as
the source code location easier.  This possibility has been considered,
but rejected, for two reasons.

     <ol type=1 start=1>
<li>Since error accepts a variable number of arguments, it could
occasionally be useful to use apply to call error.  However, this is not
possible if error was allowed to be a special form.

     <li>Since error is currently a procedure in all Scheme implementations
mentioned above, it doesn't seem all that worthwhile to allow it to be a
special form.
        </ol>
