This document describes version 0.3d2 of Vicare Scheme, an
R6RS compliant native compiler for the Scheme language, producing
single threaded programs running on Intel x86 32-bit processors, with
experimental support for 64-bit machines.  _Vicare_ is pronounced
the etruscan way.

<h4 class="subsection">14.20.3 Rationale</h4>

<p>Program arguments are the primary interface to many programs, so
processing arguments is a common programming task.  There are many common
(often conflicting) ways take care of this task, so a custom processor
is often necessary; however, many programmers (and their users) would
welcome a convenient interface supporting common guidelines.

   <p><acronym>POSIX</acronym> provides several guidelines for the specification of program
options, option&ndash;arguments, and operands.  It also notes historical
exceptions to these guidelines.  The <acronym>GNU</acronym> C Library Reference Manual
describes long option extensions to the <acronym>POSIX</acronym> guidelines.

   <p>This <acronym>SRFI</acronym> supports creating programs following the guidelines
mentioned above by:

     <ul>
<li>parsing short&ndash;options and long&ndash;options in any order and possibly
repeated;

     <li>option-arguments (possibly required or forbidden);

     <li>operands (non-option argument strings);

     <li>recognizing option processing termination. 
</ul>

   <p>It parses argument strings according to the following rules:

     <ol type=1 start=1>
<li>each short&ndash;option name is a single character;

     <li>one or more short&ndash;options are accepted in a single argument string when
grouped behind one <code>-</code> delimiter character; examples: <code>-a</code>,
<code>-bcd</code>;

     <li>a short&ndash;option&ndash;argument is accepted in a separate argument string
immediately following a short&ndash;option; examples: <code>-a foo</code>,
<code>-bcd bar</code>;

     <li>also (for historical reasons) a short&ndash;option&ndash;argument is accepted
immediately following the last short&ndash;option in a single argument
string; examples: <code>-afoo</code>, <code>-bcdbar</code>;

     <li>each long&ndash;option name is one or more characters;

     <li>one long&ndash;option is accepted in a single argument string when preceded
by two <code>-</code> delimiter characters; example: <code>--help</code>;

     <li>in a single argument string, a long&ndash;option followed by one <code>=</code>
delimiter character followed by a long&ndash;option&ndash;argument is accepted;
example: <code>--speed=fast</code>;

     <li>the first <code>--</code> argument string is accepted as a delimiter
indicating the end of options; it is not treated as an option or an
operand; any argument strings following this delimiter are treated as
operands, even if they begin with the <code>-</code> character;

     <li>all other argument strings are treated as operands; this includes
argument strings consisting of a single - character;

     <li>operands may be intermingled with options in any order.
        </ol>

   <p>Preliminary versions of this interface are already available for some
Scheme implementations: here for Chicken, and here for Scsh.
