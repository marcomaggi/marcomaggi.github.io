   <p>Streams, being the signature structured data type of functional
programming languages, find useful expression in conjunction with
higher&ndash;order functions.  Some of these higher&ndash;order functions, and
their relationship to streams, are described below.

   <p>The identity and constant procedures are frequently useful as the
recursive base for maps and folds; <code>(identity obj)</code> always returns
<var>obj</var>, and <code>(const obj)</code> creates a procedure that takes any
number of arguments and always returns the same <var>obj</var>, no matter its
arguments:

<pre class="example">     (define (identity obj) obj)
     
     (define (const obj) (lambda x obj))
</pre>
   <p>Many of the stream procedures take a unary predicate that accepts an
element of a stream and returns a boolean.  Procedure <code>(negate
pred?)</code>  takes a unary predicate and returns a new unary predicate that,
when called, returns the opposite boolean value as the original
predicate.

<pre class="example">     (define (negate pred?)
       (lambda (x) (not (pred? x))))
</pre>
   <p><code>negate</code> is useful for procedures like <code>stream-take-while</code>
that take a predicate, allowing them to be used in the opposite
direction from which they were written; for instance, with the predicate
reversed, <code>stream-take-while</code> becomes <code>stream-take-until</code>. 
<code>stream-remove</code> is the opposite of <code>stream-filter</code>:

<pre class="example">     (define-stream (stream-remove pred? strm)
       (stream-filter (negate pred?) strm))
</pre>
   <p>A section is a procedure which has been partially applied to some of its
arguments; for instance, <code>(double x)</code>, which returns twice its
argument, is a partial application of the multiply operator to the
number 2.  Sections come in two kinds:

     <ul>
<li>left sections partially apply arguments starting from the left;
<li>right sections partially apply arguments starting from the right;
</ul>

<p class="noindent">the procedure <code>lsec</code> takes a procedure and some prefix of its
arguments and returns a new procedure in which those arguments are
partially applied; the procedure <code>rsec</code> takes a procedure and some
reversed suffix of its arguments and returns a new procedure in which
those arguments are partially applied:

<pre class="example">     (define (lsec proc . args)
       (lambda x (apply proc (append args x))))
     
     (define (rsec proc . args)
       (lambda x
         (apply proc (reverse (append (reverse args) (reverse x))))))
</pre>
   <p>Since most of the stream procedures take a stream as their last
(rightmost) argument, left sections are particularly useful in
conjunction with streams.

<pre class="example">     (define stream-sum (lsec stream-fold + 0))
</pre>
   <p>Function composition creates a new function by partially applying
multiple functions, one after the other.  In the simplest case there are
only two functions, <var>f</var> and <var>g</var>, composed as <code>(compose f
g)</code>; the composition can be bound to create a new function, as in:

<pre class="example">     (define fg (compose f g))
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">The procedure <code>compose</code> takes one or more procedures and returns a
new procedure that performs the same action as the individual procedures
would if called in succession:

<pre class="example">     (define (compose . fns)
       (let comp ((fns fns))
         (cond
           [(null? fns) 'error]
           [(null? (cdr fns)) (car fns)]
           [else
             (lambda args
               (call-with-values
                 (lambda ()
                   (apply
                     (comp (cdr fns))
                     args))
                 (car fns)))])))
</pre>
   <p><code>compose</code> works with sections to create succinct but highly
expressive procedure definitions.  The expression to compute the squares
of the integers from 1 to 10 given above at <code>stream-unfold</code> could
be written by composing <code>stream-map</code>, <code>stream-take-while</code>, and
<code>stream-iterate</code>:

<pre class="example">     ([compose
       (lsec stream-map (rsec expt 2))
       (lsec stream-take-while (negate (rsec &gt; 10)))
       (lsec stream-iterate (rsec + 1))]
      1)
</pre>
