This document describes version 0.3d2 of Vicare Scheme, an
R6RS compliant native compiler for the Scheme language, producing
single threaded programs running on Intel x86 32-bit processors, with
experimental support for 64-bit machines.  _Vicare_ is pronounced
the etruscan way.

<h5 class="subsubsection">14.2.5.9 Deletion</h5>

<p><a name="index-List-deletion-4043"></a>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: <b>delete</b><var> x list </var>[<var>=</var>]<var><a name="index-delete-4044"></a></var><br>
&mdash; Function: <b>delete!</b><var> x list </var>[<var>=</var>]<var><a name="index-delete_0021-4045"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>Use the comparison procedure <var>=</var> (which defaults to <code>equal?</code>)
to find all elements of list that are equal to <var>x</var>, and delete them
from <var>list</var>.  The dynamic order in which the various applications of
<var>=</var> are made is not specified.

        <p>The list is not disordered: elements that appear in the result list
occur in the same order as they occur in the argument list.  The result
may share a common tail with the argument list.

        <p>Note that fully general element deletion can be performed with the
<code>remove</code> and <code>remove!</code> procedures:

     <pre class="example">          ;; Delete all the even elements from LIS:
          (remove even? lis)
</pre>
        <p>The comparison procedure is used in this way: <code>(= x ei)</code>; that is,
<var>x</var> is always the first argument, and a list element is always the
second argument.  The comparison procedure will be used to compare each
element of list exactly once; the order in which it is applied to the
various <var>ei</var> is not specified.  Thus, one can reliably remove all
the numbers greater than 5 from a list with <code>(delete 5 list &lt;)</code>.

        <p><code>delete!</code> is the linear&ndash;update variant of <code>delete</code>.  It is
allowed, but not required, to alter the cons cells in its argument list
to construct the result. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: <b>delete-duplicates</b><var> list </var>[<var>=</var>]<var><a name="index-delete_002dduplicates-4046"></a></var><br>
&mdash; Function: <b>delete-duplicates!</b><var> list </var>[<var>=</var>]<var><a name="index-delete_002dduplicates_0021-4047"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>Remove duplicate elements from the list argument.  If there are multiple
equal elements in <var>list</var>, the result list only contains the first or
leftmost of these elements in the result.  The order of these surviving
elements is the same as in the original list: <code>delete-duplicates</code>
does not disorder the list (hence it is useful for &ldquo;cleaning up&rdquo;
association lists).

        <p>The <var>=</var> parameter is used to compare the elements of the list; it
defaults to <code>equal?</code>.  If <var>x</var> comes before <var>y</var> in
<var>list</var>, then the comparison is performed <code>(= x y)</code>.  The
comparison procedure will be used to compare each pair of elements in
list no more than once; the order in which it is applied to the various
pairs is not specified.

        <p>Implementations of <code>delete-duplicates</code> are allowed to share common
tails between argument and result lists; for example, if the list
argument contains only unique elements, it may simply return exactly
this list.

        <p>Be aware that, in general, <code>delete-duplicates</code> runs in time O(n2)
for n&ndash;element lists.  Uniquifying long lists can be accomplished in O(n
lg n) time by sorting the list to bring equal elements together, then
using a linear&ndash;time algorithm to remove equal elements.  Alternatively,
one can use algorithms based on element&ndash;marking, with linear&ndash;time
results.

        <p><code>delete-duplicates!</code> is the linear&ndash;update variant of
<code>delete-duplicates</code>; it is allowed, but not required, to alter the
cons cells in its argument list to construct the result.

     <pre class="example">          (delete-duplicates '(a b a c a b c z)) =&gt; (a b c z)
          
          ;; Clean up an alist:
          (delete-duplicates '((a . 3) (b . 7) (a . 9) (c . 1))
                             (lambda (x y)
                               (eq? (car x) (car y))))
            =&gt; ((a . 3) (b . 7) (c . 1))
</pre>
        </blockquote></div>
