<h5 class="subsubsection">14.8.2.2 Internationalisation and super-<acronym>ASCII</acronym> character types</h5>

<p>The major issue confronting this <acronym>SRFI</acronym> is the existence of
super&ndash;<acronym>ASCII</acronym> character encodings, such as eight&ndash;bit Latin&ndash;1 or
16&ndash;bit and 32&ndash;bit Unicode.  It is a design goal of this <acronym>SRFI</acronym> for
the <acronym>API</acronym> to be portable across string implementations based on at
least these three standard encodings.  Unfortunately, this places strong
limitations on the <acronym>API</acronym> design.  Here are some relevant issues.  Be
warned that life in a super&ndash;<acronym>ASCII</acronym> world is significantly more
complex; there are no easy answers for many of these issues.

<!--  -->
<h5 class="subsubheading">Case mapping and case&ndash;folding</h5>

<p>Upper&ndash;casing and lower&ndash;casing characters is complex in super&ndash;<acronym>ASCII</acronym>
encodings.

     <ul>
<li>Some characters case&ndash;map to more than one character.  For example, the
Latin&ndash;1 German <code>eszet</code> character upper&ndash;cases to <code>SS</code>.

          <ul>
<li>This means that the <acronym>R5RS</acronym> function <code>char-upcase</code> is not
well&ndash;defined, since it is defined to produce a (single) character
result.

          <li>It means that an in&ndash;place <code>string-upcase!</code> procedure cannot be
reliably defined, since the original string may not be long enough to
contain the result; an <var>N</var>&ndash;character string might upcase to a
<var>2N</var>&ndash;character result.

          <li>It means that case&ndash;insensitive string&ndash;matching or searching is quite
tricky.  For example, an <var>n</var>&ndash;character string <var>s</var> might match a
<var>2N</var>&ndash;character string <var>s'</var>. 
</ul>

     <li>Some characters case&ndash;map in different ways depending upon their
surrounding context.  For example, the Unicode Greek capital sigma
character downcases differently depending upon whether or not it is the
final character in a word.  Again, this spells trouble for the simple
<acronym>R5RS</acronym> char&ndash;downcase function.

     <li>Unicode defines three cases: lowercase, uppercase and titlecase.  The
distinction between uppercase and titlecase arises in the presence of
Unicode's compound characters.  For example, Unicode has a single
character representing the compound pair <code>dz</code>.  Uppercasing the
<code>dz</code> character produces the compound character <code>DZ</code>, while
titlecasing (or, as Americans say, capitalizing) it produces compound
character <code>Dz</code>.

     <li>Turkish actually has different case&ndash;mappings from other languages. 
</ul>

   <p>The Unicode Consortium's web site:

<div align="center"><a href="http://www.unicode.org/">http://www.unicode.org/</a></div>

<p class="noindent">has detailed discussions of the issues.  See in particular technical
report 21 on case mappings:

<div align="center"><a href="http://www.unicode.org/unicode/reports/tr21/">http://www.unicode.org/unicode/reports/tr21/</a></div>

   <p><acronym>SRFI</acronym>-13 makes no attempt to deal with these issues; it uses a simple
one&ndash;to&ndash;ont locale&ndash;independent and context&ndash;independent case&ndash;mapping,
specifically Unicode's one&ndash;to&ndash;one case&ndash;mappings given in:

<div align="center"><a href="ftp://ftp.unicode.org/Public/UNIDATA/UnicodeData.txt">ftp://ftp.unicode.org/Public/UNIDATA/UnicodeData.txt</a></div>

   <p>The format of this file is explained in:

<div align="center"><a href="ftp://ftp.unicode.org/Public/UNIDATA/UnicodeData.html">ftp://ftp.unicode.org/Public/UNIDATA/UnicodeData.html</a></div>

   <p>Note that this means that German <code>eszet</code> upper&ndash;cases to itself,
not <code>SS</code>.

   <p>Case&ndash;mapping and case&ndash;folding operations in <acronym>SRFI</acronym>-13 are
locale&ndash;independent so that shifting locales won't wreck hash tables,
b&ndash;trees, symbol tables, etc.

<!--  -->
<h5 class="subsubheading">String equality and string normalisation</h5>

<p>Comparing strings for equality is complicated because in some cases
Unicode actually provides multiple encodings for the &ldquo;same&rdquo; character,
and because what we usually think of as a &ldquo;character&rdquo; can be
represented in Unicode as a sequence of several code&ndash;points.  For
example, consider the letter <code>e</code> with an acute accent.  There is a
single Unicode character for this.  However, Unicode also allows one to
represent this with a two&ndash;character sequence: the <code>e</code> character
followed by a zero&ndash;width acute&ndash;accent character.  As another example,
Unicode provides some Asian characters in &ldquo;narrow&rdquo; and &ldquo;full&rdquo;
widths.

   <p>There are multiple ways we might want to compare strings for equality. 
In (roughly) decreasing order of precision:

     <ul>
<li>we might want a precise comparison of the actual encoding, so that
<code>&lt;e-acute&gt;</code> would not compare equal to <code>&lt;e, acute&gt;</code>;

     <li>we might want a &ldquo;normalised&rdquo; comparison, where these two sequences
would compare equal;

     <li>we might want an even more&ndash;permissive normalisation, where
visually&ndash;distinct properties of &ldquo;the same&rdquo; character would be
ignored; for example, we might want narrow/full&ndash;width versions of the
same Asian character to compare equal;

     <li>we might want comparisons that are insensitive to accents and
diacritical marks;

     <li>we might want comparisons that are case&ndash;insensitive;

     <li>we might want comparisons that are insensitive to several of the above
properties;

     <li>we might want ways to &ldquo;normalise&rdquo; strings into various canonical
forms. 
</ul>

   <p>This library does not address these complexities.  <acronym>SRFI</acronym>-13 string
equality is simply based upon comparing the encoding values used for the
characters.  Accent&ndash;insensitive and other types of comparison are not
provided; only a simple form of case&ndash;insensitive comparison is
provided, which uses the one&ndash;to&ndash;one case mappings specified by Unicode
in:

<div align="center"><a href="ftp://ftp.unicode.org/Public/UNIDATA/UnicodeData.txt">ftp://ftp.unicode.org/Public/UNIDATA/UnicodeData.txt</a></div>

   <p>These are adequate for &ldquo;program&rdquo; or &ldquo;systems&rdquo; use of strings (e.g. 
to manipulate program identifiers and operating&ndash;system filenames).

<!--  -->
<h5 class="subsubheading">String inequality</h5>

<p>Above and beyond the issues arising in string&ndash;equality, when we attempt
to order strings there are even further considerations.

     <ul>
<li>French orders accents with right&ndash;to&ndash;left significance; the reverse of
the significance of the characters.

     <li>Case&ndash;insensitive ordering is not well defined by simple code&ndash;point
considerations, even for simple <acronym>ASCII</acronym>: there are punctuation
characters between the <acronym>ASCII</acronym>'s upper&ndash;case range of letters and its
lower&ndash;case range (left&ndash;bracket, backslash, right&ndash;bracket, caret,
underbar and backquote).  Does left&ndash;bracket compare less&ndash;than or
greater&ndash;than <code>a</code> in a case&ndash;insensitive comparison?

     <li>The German <code>eszet</code> character should sort as if it were the pair of
letters <code>ss</code>. 
</ul>

   <p>Unicode defines a complex set of machinery for ordering or &ldquo;collating&rdquo;
strings, which involves mapping each string to a multi&ndash;byte sort key,
and then doing simple lexicographic sorting with these keys.  These
rules can be overlaid by additional domain&ndash;specific or
language&ndash;specific rules.  Again, this <acronym>SRFI</acronym> does not address these
issues.  <acronym>SRFI</acronym>-13 string ordering is strictly based upon a
character&ndash;by&ndash;character comparison of the values used for representing
the string.
