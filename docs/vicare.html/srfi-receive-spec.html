<blockquote><p><var>formals</var>, <var>expression</var>, and <var>body</var> are as described in
<acronym>R5RS</acronym>.  Specifically, <var>formals</var> can have any of three forms:

          <dl>
<dt><code>(variable1 ... variablen)</code><dd>The environment in which the <code>receive</code>&ndash;expression is evaluated is
extended by binding <var>variable1</var>, ..., <var>variablen</var> to fresh
locations.  The <var>expression</var> is evaluated, and its values are stored
into those locations (it is an error if <var>expression</var> does not have
exactly <var>n</var> values).

          <br><dt><code>variable</code><dd>The environment in which the <code>receive</code>&ndash;expression is evaluated is
extended by binding <var>variable</var> to a fresh location.  The
<var>expression</var> is evaluated, its values are converted into a newly
allocated list, and the list is stored in the location bound to
<var>variable</var>.

          <br><dt><code>(variable1 ... variablen . variablen+1)</code><dd>The environment in which the <code>receive</code>&ndash;expression is evaluated is
extended by binding <var>variable1</var>, ..., <var>variablen+1</var> to fresh
locations.  The <var>expression</var> is evaluated.  Its first <var>n</var> values
are stored into the locations bound to <var>variable1</var>, ...,
<var>variablen</var>.  Any remaining values are converted into a newly
allocated list, which is stored into the location bound to
<var>variablen+1</var> (it is an error if <var>expression</var> does not have at
least <var>n</var> values. 
</dl>

        <p>In any case, the expressions in <var>body</var> are evaluated sequentially in
the extended environment.  The results of the last expression in the
body are the values of the <var>receive</var>&ndash;expression.
