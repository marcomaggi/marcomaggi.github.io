This document describes version 0.2d19 of Vicare Scheme, an
R6RS compliant native compiler for the Scheme language, producing
single threaded programs running on Intel x86 32-bit processors, with
experimental support for 64-bit machines.  _Vicare_ is pronounced
the etruscan way.

<h3 class="section">1.2 Technology overview</h3>

<p>Vicare Scheme provides the programmer with many advantages:

     <dl>
<dt><strong>Optimizing code generator</strong><dd>The compiler's backend employs state of the art technologies in code
generation that produce fast, efficient, machine code.  When developing
computationally intensive programs, one is not constrained by using a
slow interpreter.

     <br><dt><strong>Fast incremental compilation</strong><dd>Every library and script is quickly compiled to native machine code. 
When developing large software, one is not constrained by how slow the
batch compiler runs.

     <br><dt><strong>Robust and fine&ndash;tuned standard libraries</strong><dd>The standard libraries are written such that they perform as much error
checking as required to provide a safe and fast runtime environment.

     <br><dt><strong>Multi&ndash;generational garbage collector</strong><dd>The BiBOP based garbage collector used in Vicare allows the runtime
system to expand its memory footprint as needed.  The entire 32-bit
virtual address space could be used and unneeded memory is released back
to the operating system.

     <br><dt><strong>Supports many operating systems</strong><dd>Vicare runs on the most popular and widely used operating systems for
servers and personal computers.  The supported systems include Mac OS X,
<acronym>GNU</acronym>+Linux, FreeBSD, NetBSD, and Microsoft Windows (under Cygwin).
