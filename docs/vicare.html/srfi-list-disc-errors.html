<h5 class="subsubsection">14.2.4.4 Errors</h5>

<p>Note that statements of the form &ldquo;it is an error&rdquo; merely mean &ldquo;don't
do that&rdquo;.  They are no a guarantees that a conforming implementation
will &ldquo;catch&rdquo; such improper use by, for example, raising some kind of
exception.  Regrettably, <acronym>R5RS</acronym> Scheme requires no firmer guarantee
even for basic operators such as <code>car</code> and <code>cdr</code>, so there's
little point in requiring these procedures to do more.  Here is the
relevant section of the <acronym>R5RS</acronym>:

   <blockquote>
When speaking of an error situation, this report uses the phrase &ldquo;an
error is signalled&rdquo; to indicate that implementations must detect and
report the error.  If such wording does not appear in the discussion of
an error, then implementations are not required to detect or report the
error, though they are encouraged to do so.  An error situation that
implementations are not required to detect is usually referred to simply
as &ldquo;an error&rdquo;.

   <p>For example, it is an error for a procedure to be passed an argument
that the procedure is not explicitly specified to handle, even though
such domain errors are seldom mentioned in this report.  Implementations
may extend a procedure's domain of definition to include such arguments.
