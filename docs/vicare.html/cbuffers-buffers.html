This document describes version 0.3d0 of Vicare Scheme, an
R6RS compliant native compiler for the Scheme language, producing
single threaded programs running on Intel x86 32-bit processors, with
experimental support for 64-bit machines.  _Vicare_ is pronounced
the etruscan way.

<h4 class="subsection">13.5.1 Introduction to generalised C buffers</h4>

<p>Generalised C buffers are meant to be used in interfaces to foreign C
language libraries, when a pointer to raw data is required as argument.

   <p>A <dfn>generalised C buffer</dfn> is an object capable of holding an array of
mutable bytes referenced by a pointer; such Scheme objects are:
bytevectors, pointer objects, instances of <code>memory-block</code>.

   <p>A <dfn>generalised C sticky buffer</dfn> is an object capable of holding an
array of mutable bytes referenced by a pointer, whose data area is never
moved around by the garbage collector; such Scheme objects are: pointer
objects, instances of <code>memory-block</code>.  Sticky buffers are meant to
be used when calling out to C functions that call back to Scheme.

   <p><a href="iklib-memory-blocks.html#iklib-memory-blocks">iklib memory blocks</a> for details on memory blocks.

   <p>Two arguments to function are usually needed to represent a generalised
C buffer: the buffer value itself and an optional length.

     <ol type=1 start=1>
<li>The buffer argument is meant to be either bytevector, or
<code>memory-block</code> instance, or pointer object.

     <li>The length argument is meant to be <code>#f</code> or an exact integer in the
range of the C language type <code>size_t</code>.  When the buffer argument is
a pointer object: the length argument must represent the number of bytes
available in the referenced memory block; otherwise the length argument
is ignored.
        </ol>

   <p>Here is an example function accepting a generalised C buffer argument
<var>buf</var> and its optional length argument <var>buf.len</var>:

<pre class="example">     (define fun
       (case-lambda
         ((buf)
          (fun buf #f))
         ((buf buf.len)
          (define who 'fun)
          (with-arguments-validation (who)
              ((general-c-buffer     buf)
               (general-c-buffer.len buf buf.len))
            (do-something-with buf buf.len)))))
</pre>
