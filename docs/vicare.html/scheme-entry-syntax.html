This document describes version 0.3d1 of Vicare Scheme, an
R6RS compliant native compiler for the Scheme language, producing
single threaded programs running on Intel x86 32-bit processors, with
experimental support for 64-bit machines.  _Vicare_ is pronounced
the etruscan way.

<h4 class="subsection">3.6.1 Syntax entries</h4>

<p>If <em>category</em> is &ldquo;Syntax&rdquo;, the entry describes a special
syntactic construct, and the template gives the syntax of the forms of
the construct.  The template is written in a notation similar to a
right&ndash;hand side of the <acronym>BNF</acronym> rules in chapter &ldquo;Lexical syntax
and datum syntax&rdquo;, and describes the set of forms equivalent to the
forms matching the template as syntactic data.  Some &ldquo;Syntax&rdquo; entries
carry a suffix (<code>expand</code>), specifying that the syntactic keyword of
the construct is exported with level 1.  Otherwise, the syntactic
keyword is exported with level 0; <a href="scheme-library-import-export.html#scheme-library-import-export">scheme library import export</a>.

   <p>Components of the form described by a template are designated by
syntactic variables, which are written using angle brackets, for
example, <var>?expression</var>, <var>?variable</var>.  Case is insignificant in
syntactic variables.  Syntactic variables stand for other forms, or
sequences of them.  A syntactic variable may refer to a non&ndash;terminal in
the grammar for syntactic data, in which case only forms matching that
non&ndash;terminal are permissible in that position.  For example,
<var>?identifier</var> stands for a form which must be an identifier.  Also,
<var>?expression</var> stands for any form which is a syntactically valid
expression.  Other non&ndash;terminals that are used in templates are defined
as part of the specification.

   <p>The notation

<pre class="example">     <var>?thing1</var> ...
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">indicates zero or more occurrences of a <var>?thing</var>, and

<pre class="example">     <var>?thing1</var> <var>?thing2</var> ...
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">indicates one or more occurrences of a <var>?thing</var>.

   <p>It is the programmer's responsibility to ensure that each component of a
form has the shape specified by a template.  Descriptions of syntax may
express other restrictions on the components of a form.  Typically, such
a restriction is formulated as a phrase of the form &ldquo;<var>?x</var> must be a
<small class="dots">...</small>&rdquo;.  Again, these specify the programmer's responsibility.  It is
the implementation's responsibility to check that these restrictions are
satisfied, as long as the macro transformers involved in expanding the
form terminate.  If the implementation detects that a component does not
meet the restriction, an exception with condition type <code>&amp;syntax</code>
is raised.
