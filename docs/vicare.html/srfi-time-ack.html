<h4 class="subsection">10.11.4 Acknowledgements</h4>

<p>Claus Toendering's Frequently Asked Questions about calendars was a very
useful resource.  The implementation of Julian Day, Modified Julian Day,
and Year Day comes from his <acronym>FAQ</acronym>.  Markus Kuhn has a useful
description of the <acronym>ISO</acronym> Standard 8601 for Date/Time notation.  The W3
Consortium also has a useful Note.

   <p>Mike Sperber, Marc Feely, Dave Mason, and &ldquo;Prfnoff&rdquo; all made useful
comments on previous versions of this draft.  Thanks to Shriram
Krishnamurthi for his editing help.

   <p>The <code>date-&gt;string</code> procedure uses a format string, based on <acronym>GNU</acronym>
C's <code>date()</code> procedure, as well as Scsh's <code>format-date</code>
procedure.
