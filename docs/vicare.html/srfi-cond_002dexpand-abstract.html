This document describes version 0.3d2 of Vicare Scheme, an
R6RS compliant native compiler for the Scheme language, producing
single threaded programs running on Intel x86 32-bit processors, with
experimental support for 64-bit machines.  _Vicare_ is pronounced
the etruscan way.

<h4 class="subsection">14.1.2 Abstract</h4>

<p>It is desirable that programs which depend on additions to standard
Scheme name those additions.  <acronym>SRFI</acronym>s provide the specifications of
these additions (&ldquo;features&rdquo;), and <acronym>SRFI</acronym>-0 provides the means to
actually check that these features are present in the Scheme system by
means of the <code>cond-expand</code> construct.  It is anticipated that there
will be two main classes of features:

     <ul>
<li>sets of value and syntax bindings;

     <li>reader syntax extensions;
</ul>

<p class="noindent">&ldquo;reader syntax&rdquo; refers to aspects of the syntax described by the
grammars in the Scheme reports.

   <p>The former class of features will probably include most <acronym>SRFI</acronym>s,
exemplified by the list library specified in <acronym>SRFI</acronym>-1.  The latter class
includes Unicode source code support and different kinds of parentheses.

   <p>Control over the presence of individual features will vary over
different Scheme systems.  A given feature may be absent or provided by
default in some Scheme systems and in others some mechanism (such as an
<code>import</code> clause in the code or a program configuration file, a
command line option, a dependency declaration in a module definition,
etc.) will be required for the feature to be present in the system.

   <p>Moreover, in some systems a given feature may be in effect throughout
the entire program if it is in effect anywhere at all.  Other systems
may have more precise mechanisms to control the scope of a feature (this
might be the case for example when a module system is supported).  In
general it is thus possible that a feature is in effect in some parts of
the program and not in others.  This allows conflicting <acronym>SRFI</acronym>s to be
present in a given program as long as their scope do not intersect.

   <p><acronym>SRFI</acronym>-0 does not prescribe a particular mechanism for controlling the
presence of a feature as it is our opinion that this should be the role
of a module system.  We expect that future module system <acronym>SRFI</acronym>s will
need to extend the semantics of <acronym>SRFI</acronym>-0 for their purposes, for
example by defining feature scoping rules or by generalizing the feature
testing construct.
