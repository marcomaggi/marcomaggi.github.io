This document describes version 0.2d19 of Vicare Scheme, an
R6RS compliant native compiler for the Scheme language, producing
single threaded programs running on Intel x86 32-bit processors, with
experimental support for 64-bit machines.  _Vicare_ is pronounced
the etruscan way.

<h3 class="section">3.18 Local library imports</h3>

<p>Local <code>import</code> forms are useful for the following reasons:

     <ol type=1 start=1>
<li>They minimize the namespace clutter that usually occurs when many
libraries are imported at the top level.

     <li>They limit the scope of the import and thus help modularize a library's
dependencies.
        </ol>

   <p>Let's suppose we are constructing a large library and at some point we
realize that a procedure needs to make use of some other library to
performing a specific task; importing that library at top level makes it
available for the entire library.  Consequently, even if that library is
no longer used anywhere in the code (say when the code that uses it is
deleted), it becomes very hard to delete the import without first
examiniming the entire library body for potential usage leaks.  By
locally importing a library into the appropriate scope, we gain the
ability to delete the <code>import</code> form when the procedure that was
using it is deleted.

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Syntax: <b>import</b><var> ?import-spec ...<a name="index-import-254"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This syntax can be used anywhere definitions can occur:

          <ol type=1 start=1>
<li>In a script body.

          <li>At library's top&ndash;level.

          <li>In internal definitions context.
             </ol>

        <p>The syntax of the local <code>import</code> form is similar to the
<code>import</code> that appears at the top of a library or a script form, and
carries with it the same restrictions:

          <ul>
<li>No identifier name may be imported twice unless it denotes the same
identifier.

          <li>No identifier may be both imported and defined.

          <li>Imported identifiers are immutable. 
</ul>

        <p>Each <var>?import-spec</var> can be as defined by <acronym>R6RS</acronym> or a symbol
representing the name of a module; notice that module import
specifications can be only symbols, <strong>without</strong> prefixes, renaming
and the features allowed for libraries. 
</p></blockquote></div>

   <p>In the following example we import a library in the body of a function:

<pre class="example">     ;;; file "alpha.sls"
     (library (alpha)
       (export doit)
       (import (vicare))
       (define (doit)
         (fprintf (current-error-port) "From alpha!\n")))
     
     ;;; file "beta.sls"
     (library (beta)
       (export doit)
       (import (vicare))
       (define (doit)
         (fprintf (current-error-port) "From beta!\n")))
     
     ;;; file "program.sps"
     (import (vicare)
       (alpha))
     (define (do-that)
       (import (beta))
       (doit))
     (doit)
     (do-that)
     -| From alpha!
     -| From beta!
</pre>
   <p>In the following example we import bindings from a module in the body of
a function:

<pre class="example">     (import (vicare))
     
     (define (doit)
       (fprintf (current-error-port) "From body!\n"))
     
     (module do-stuff
       (doit)
       (define (doit)
         (fprintf (current-error-port) "From module!\n")))
     
     (define (do-that)
       (import do-stuff)
       (doit))
     
     (doit)
     (do-that)
     -| From body!
     -| From module!
</pre>
