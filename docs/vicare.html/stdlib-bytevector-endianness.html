This document describes version 0.3d1 of Vicare Scheme, an
R6RS compliant native compiler for the Scheme language, producing
single threaded programs running on Intel x86 32-bit processors, with
experimental support for 64-bit machines.  _Vicare_ is pronounced
the etruscan way.

<h4 class="subsection">5.2.1 Endianness</h4>

<p>Many operations described in this chapter accept an <var>endianness</var>
argument.  Endianness describes the encoding of exact integer objects as
several contiguous bytes in a bytevector.  For this purpose, the binary
representation of the integer object is split into consecutive bytes. 
The little&ndash;endian encoding places the least significant byte of an
integer first, with the other bytes following in increasing order of
significance.  The big&ndash;endian encoding places the most significant byte
of an integer first, with the other bytes following in decreasing order
of significance.

   <p>This terminology also applies to <acronym>IEEE</acronym> 754 numbers: <acronym>IEEE</acronym> 754
describes how to represent a floating&ndash;point number as an exact integer
object, and endianness describes how the bytes of such an integer are
laid out in a bytevector.

   <blockquote>
<strong>NOTE</strong> Little and big&ndash;endianness are only the most common kinds
of endianness.  Some architectures distinguish between the endianness at
different levels of a binary representation.
