<h5 class="subsubheading">Formal Grammar of the New External Representation</h5>

<p>This <acronym>SRFI</acronym> creates an alternative external representation for data
written and read under <code>write/ss</code> and <code>read/ss</code>.  It is
identical to the grammar for external representation for data written
and read under <code>write</code> and <code>read</code> given in section 7 of
<acronym>R5RS</acronym>, except that the single production:

<pre class="example">     &lt;datum&gt; --&gt; &lt;simple datum&gt; | &lt;compound datum&gt;
</pre>
   <p>Is replaced by the following five productions.

<pre class="example">     &lt;datum&gt; --&gt; &lt;defining datum&gt; | &lt;nondefining datum&gt; | &lt;defined datum&gt;
     
     &lt;defining datum&gt; --&gt;  #&lt;indexnum&gt;=&lt;nondefining datum&gt;
     
     &lt;defined datum&gt; --&gt; #&lt;indexnum&gt;#
     
     &lt;nondefining datum&gt; --&gt; &lt;simple datum&gt; | &lt;compound datum&gt;
     
     &lt;indexnum&gt; --&gt; &lt;digit 10&gt;+
</pre>
   <h5 class="subsubheading">New Procedures</h5>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Procedure: <b>write-with-shared-structure</b><var> obj<a name="index-write_002dwith_002dshared_002dstructure-4587"></a></var><br>
&mdash; Procedure: <b>write-with-shared-structure</b><var> obj port<a name="index-write_002dwith_002dshared_002dstructure-4588"></a></var><br>
&mdash; Procedure: <b>write-with-shared-structure</b><var> obj port optarg<a name="index-write_002dwith_002dshared_002dstructure-4589"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>Writes a written representation of <var>obj</var> to the given <var>port</var>. 
Strings that appear in the written representation are enclosed in
doublequotes, and within those strings backslash and doublequote
characters are escaped by backslashes.  Character objects are written
using the <code>#\</code> notation.

        <p>Objects which denote locations rather than values (cons cells, vectors,
and non&ndash;zero&ndash;length strings in <acronym>R5RS</acronym> scheme; also mutable objects,
records, or containers if provided by the implementation), if they
appear at more than one point in the data being written, must be
preceded by <code>#N=</code> the first time they are written and replaced by
<code>#N#</code> all subsequent times they are written, where <var>N</var> is a
natural number used to identify that particular object.

        <p>If objects which denote locations occur only once in the structure, then
<code>write-with-shared-structure</code> must produce the same external
representation for those objects as <code>write</code>.

        <p><code>write-with-shared-structure</code> must terminate in finite time when
writing finite data.  <code>write-with-shared-structure</code> must produce a
finite representation when writing finite data.

        <p><code>write-with-shared-structure</code> returns an unspecified value.

        <p>The <var>port</var> argument may be omitted, in which case it defaults to the
value returned by <code>current-output-port</code>.

        <p>The <var>optarg</var> argument may also be omitted.  If present, its effects
on the output and return value are unspecified but
<code>write-with-shared-structure</code> must still write a representation
that can be read by <code>read-with-shared-structure</code>.  Some
implementations may wish to use <var>optarg</var> to specify formatting
conventions, numeric radixes, or return values.  The reference
implementation ignores optarg.

        <p>For example, the code:

     <pre class="example">          (begin (define a (cons 'val1 'val2))
                 (set-cdr! a a)
                 (write-with-shared-structure a))
</pre>
        <p class="noindent">should produce the output <code>#1=(val1 . #1#)</code>.  This shows a cons
cell whose cdr contains itself. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Procedure: <b>read-with-shared-structure</b><var><a name="index-read_002dwith_002dshared_002dstructure-4590"></a></var><br>
&mdash; Procedure: <b>read-with-shared-structure</b><var> port<a name="index-read_002dwith_002dshared_002dstructure-4591"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p><code>read-with-shared-structure</code> converts the external representations
of Scheme objects produced by <code>write-with-shared-structure</code> into
scheme objects.  That is, it is a parser for the nonterminal
<code>&lt;datum&gt;</code> in the augmented external representation grammar defined
above.

        <p><code>read-with-shared-structure</code> returns the next object parsable from
the given input port, updating port to point to the first character past
the end of the external representation of the object.

        <p>If an end&ndash;of&ndash;file is encountered in the input before any characters
are found that can begin an object, then an end&ndash;of&ndash;file object is
returned.  The port remains open, and further attempts to read it (by
<code>read-with-shared-structure</code> or <code>read</code>) will also return an
end&ndash;of&ndash;file object.  If an end&ndash;of&ndash;file is encountered after the
beginning of an object's external representation, but the external
representation is incomplete and therefore not parsable, an error is
signalled.

        <p>The <var>port</var> argument may be omitted, in which case it defaults to the
value returned by <code>current-input-port</code>.  It is an error to read
from a closed port.
