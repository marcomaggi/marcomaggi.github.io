This document describes version 0.3d2 of Vicare Scheme, an
R6RS compliant native compiler for the Scheme language, producing
single threaded programs running on Intel x86 32-bit processors, with
experimental support for 64-bit machines.  _Vicare_ is pronounced
the etruscan way.

<h4 class="subsection">3.3.4 Implementation requirements</h4>

<p>Implementations of Scheme must support number objects for the entire
tower of subtypes given in <a href="scheme-numbers-tower.html#scheme-numbers-tower">Numerical tower</a>. 
Moreover, implementations must support exact integer objects and exact
rational number objects of practically unlimited size and precision, and
to implement certain procedures (listed in <a href="baselib-math-exactness.html#baselib-math-exactness">Propagation of exactness and inexactness</a>), so they always return exact
results when given exact arguments.  (&ldquo;Practically unlimited&rdquo; means
that the size and precision of these numbers should only be limited by
the size of the available memory.)

   <p>Implementations may support only a limited range of inexact number
objects of any type, subject to the requirements of this section.  For
example, an implementation may limit the range of the inexact real
number objects (and therefore the range of inexact integer and rational
number objects) to the dynamic range of the flonum format.  Furthermore
the gaps between the inexact integer objects and rationals are likely to
be very large in such an implementation as the limits of this range are
approached.

   <p>An implementation may use floating point and other approximate
representation strategies for <em>inexact</em> numbers.  This report
recommends, but does not require, that the <acronym>IEEE</acronym> floating&ndash;point
standards be followed by implementations that use floating&ndash;point
representations, and that implementations using other representations
should match or exceed the precision achievable using these
floating&ndash;point standards.

   <p>In particular, implementations that use floating&ndash;point representations
must follow these rules: A floating&ndash;point result must be represented
with at least as much precision as is used to express any of the inexact
arguments to that operation.  Potentially inexact operations such as
<code>sqrt</code>, when applied to exact arguments, should produce exact
answers whenever possible (for example the square root of an exact 4
ought to be an exact 2).  However, this is not required.  If, on the
other hand, an exact number object is operated upon so as to produce an
inexact result (as by <code>sqrt</code>), and if the result is represented in
floating point, then the most precise floating&ndash;point format available
must be used; but if the result is represented in some other way then
the representation must have at least as much precision as the most
precise floating&ndash;point format available.

   <p>It is the programmer's responsibility to avoid using inexact number
objects with magnitude or significand too large to be represented in the
implementation.
