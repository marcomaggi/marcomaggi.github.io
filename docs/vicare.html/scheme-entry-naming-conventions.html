<h4 class="subsection">3.6.7 Naming conventions</h4>

<p>By convention, the names of procedures that store values into previously
allocated locations usually end in <code>!</code>.

   <p>By convention, <code>-&gt;</code> appears within the names of procedures that
take an object of one type and return an analogous object of another
type.  For example, <code>list-&gt;vector</code> takes a list and returns a
vector whose elements are the same as those of the list.

   <p>By convention, the names of predicates (procedures that always return a
boolean value) end in <code>?</code> when the name contains any letters;
otherwise, the predicate's name does not end with a question mark.

   <p>By convention, the components of compound names are separated by
<code>-</code>.  In particular, prefixes that are actual words or can be
pronounced as though they were actual words are followed by a hyphen,
except when the first character following the hyphen would be something
other than a letter, in which case the hyphen is omitted.  Short,
unpronounceable prefixes (<code>fx</code> and <code>fl</code>) are not followed by a
hyphen.

   <p>By convention, the names of condition types start with <code>&amp;</code>.
