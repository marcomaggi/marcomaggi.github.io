This document describes version 0.2d20 of Vicare Scheme, an
R6RS compliant native compiler for the Scheme language, producing
single threaded programs running on Intel x86 32-bit processors, with
experimental support for 64-bit machines.  _Vicare_ is pronounced
the etruscan way.

<h4 class="subsection">10.16.3 Rationale</h4>

<p>This <acronym>SRFI</acronym> defines an interface for sources of random bits computed
by a pseudo random number generator.  The interface provides
range&ndash;limited integer and real numbers.  It allows accessing the state
of the underlying generator.  Moreover, it is possible to obtain a large
number of independent generators and to invoke a mild form of true
randomization.

   <p>The design aims at sufficient flexibility to cover the usage patterns of
many applications as diverse as discrete structures, numerical
simulations, and cryptographic protocols.  At the same time, the
interface aims at simplicity, which is important for occasional use.  As
there is no &ldquo;one size fits all&rdquo; random number generator, the design
necessarily represents some form of compromise between the needs of the
various applications.

   <p>Although strictly speaking not part of the specification, the emphasis
of this proposal is on high quality random numbers and on high
performance.  As the state of the art in pseudo random number generators
is still advancing considerably, the choice of method for the reference
implementation should essentially be considered preliminary.
