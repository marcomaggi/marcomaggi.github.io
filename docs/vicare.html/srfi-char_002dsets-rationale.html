experimental support for 64-bit machines.  _Vicare_ is pronounced
the etruscan way.

<h4 class="subsection">10.9.2 Rationale</h4>

<p>The ability to efficiently manipulate sets of characters is quite useful
for text&ndash;processing code.  Encapsulating this functionality in a
general, efficiently implemented library can assist all such code.  This
library defines a new data structure to represent these sets, called a
<code>char-set</code>.  The <code>char-set</code> type is distinct from all other
types.

   <p>The procedures of this <acronym>SRFI</acronym>, by default, are &ldquo;pure functional&rdquo;,
they do not alter their parameters.  However, this <acronym>SRFI</acronym> defines a set
of &ldquo;linear&ndash;update&rdquo; procedures which have a hybrid
pure&ndash;functional/side&ndash;effecting semantics: they are allowed, but not
required, to side&ndash;effect one of their parameters in order to construct
their result.  An implementation may legally implement these procedures
as pure, side&ndash;effect-free functions, or it may implement them using
side effects, depending upon the details of what is the most efficient
or simple to implement in terms of the underlying representation.

   <p>The linear&ndash;update routines all have names ending with <code>!</code>.

   <p>Clients of these procedures may not rely upon these procedures working
by side effect.  For example, this is not guaranteed to work:

<pre class="example">     (let* ((cs1 (char-set #\a #\b #\c))      ; cs1 = {a,b,c}.
            (cs2 (char-set-adjoin! cs1 #\d))) ; Add d to {a,b,c}.
       cs1) ; Could be either {a,b,c} or {a,b,c,d}.
</pre>
   <p>However, this is well&ndash;defined:

<pre class="example">     (let ((cs (char-set #\a #\b #\c)))
       (char-set-adjoin! cs #\d)) ; Add d to {a,b,c}.
</pre>
   <p>So clients of these procedures write in a functional style, but must
additionally be sure that, when the procedure is called, there are no
other live pointers to the potentially&ndash;modified character set (hence
the term &ldquo;linear update&rdquo;).

   <p>There are two benefits to this convention:

     <ul>
<li>Implementations are free to provide the most efficient possible
implementation, either functional or side&ndash;effecting.

     <li>Programmers may nonetheless continue to assume that character sets are
purely functional data structures: they may be reliably shared without
needing to be copied, uniquified, and so forth. 
</ul>

   <p>Note that pure functional representations are the right thing for
<acronym>ASCII</acronym> or Latin-1 based Scheme implementations, since a
<code>char-set</code> can be represented in an <acronym>ASCII</acronym> Scheme with 4
32-bit words.  Pure set&ndash;algebra operations on such a representation are
very fast and efficient.  Programmers who code using linear&ndash;update
operations are guaranteed the system will provide the best
implementation across multiple platforms.

   <p>In practice, these procedures are most useful for efficiently
constructing character sets in a side&ndash;effecting manner, in some limited
local context, before passing the character set outside the local
construction scope to be used in a functional manner.

   <p>Scheme provides no assistance in checking the linearity of the
potentially side&ndash;effected parameters passed to these functions; there's
no linear type checker or run&ndash;time mechanism for detecting violations.
