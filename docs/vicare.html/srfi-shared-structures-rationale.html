This document describes version 0.3d0 of Vicare Scheme, an
R6RS compliant native compiler for the Scheme language, producing
single threaded programs running on Intel x86 32-bit processors, with
experimental support for 64-bit machines.  _Vicare_ is pronounced
the etruscan way.

<h4 class="subsection">11.14.3 Rationale</h4>

<p><acronym>R5RS</acronym> scheme and <acronym>IEEE</acronym> scheme provide the procedure <code>write</code>,
which prints machine&ndash;readable representations of lists and other
objects.  However, the printed representation does not preserve
information about what parts of the structure are shared, and in the
case of self&ndash;referential objects the behavior of <code>write</code> itself is
undefined; it is permitted to go into an infinite loop or invoke the
dreaded curse of the nasal demons.

   <p>For example, it is possible to have a list within which two or more
members are the same string (in the sense of <code>eq?</code>), but when the
list is written, there is not sufficient information in the
representation to recover the <code>eq?</code> relationship.  When the list is
read back in, there will be two or more copies of the string which are
<code>eqv?</code> but not <code>eq?</code>.

   <p>As an example of the second problem, the results of evaluating:

<pre class="example">     (begin (define a (cons 'val1 'val2))
            (set-cdr! a a)
            (write a))
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">are undefined; in <acronym>R5RS</acronym> parlance, calling <code>write</code> on such a
structure &ldquo;is an error&rdquo;, but not one that is necessarily signalled. 
The routine is permitted to print a nonstandard notation such as the one
proposed in this standard or a different one, fail silently, signal an
error, go into an infinite loop, or make demons fly out of your nose. 
Some of these results are unacceptable in some cases.  This <acronym>SRFI</acronym>
hopes to provide a standard way of dealing with this problem by
providing a method of writing data which is guaranteed to be
well&ndash;behaved and predictable even on data containing shared structures.

   <p>The extended functionality described below in the implementation of
<code>write-with-shared-structure</code> is already present in the
<code>write</code> function of several major scheme implementations (PLT,
SISC, Chez, Bigloo, MIT scheme, and possibly others).
