This document describes version 0.3d2 of Vicare Scheme, an
R6RS compliant native compiler for the Scheme language, producing
single threaded programs running on Intel x86 32-bit processors, with
experimental support for 64-bit machines.  _Vicare_ is pronounced
the etruscan way.

<blockquote><p>Return a newly allocated mutable hashtable that accepts arbitrary

<blockquote><p><var>hash-function</var> and <var>equiv</var> must be procedures. 
<var>hash-function</var> should accept a key as an argument and should return
a non&ndash;negative exact integer object.  <var>equiv</var> should accept two
keys as arguments and return a single value.  Neither procedure should
mutate the hashtable returned by <code>make-hashtable</code>.

        <p>The <code>make-hashtable</code> procedure returns a newly allocated mutable
hashtable using <var>hash-function</var> as the hash function and <var>equiv</var>
as the equivalence function used to compare keys.  If a third argument
is given, the initial capacity of the hashtable is set to approximately
<var>k</var> elements.

        <p>Both <var>hash-function</var> and <var>equiv</var> should behave like pure
functions on the domain of keys.  For example, the <code>string-hash</code>
and <code>string=?</code> procedures are permissible only if all keys are
strings and the contents of those strings are never changed so long as
any of them continues to serve as a key in the hashtable.  Furthermore,
any pair of keys for which <var>equiv</var> returns true should be hashed to
the same exact integer objects by <var>hash-function</var>.

        <p><strong>Implementation responsibilities:</strong> The implementation must check
the restrictions on <var>hash-function</var> and <var>equiv</var> to the extent
performed by applying them as described.

        <blockquote>
<strong>NOTE</strong> Hashtables are allowed to cache the results of calling the
hash function and equivalence function, so programs cannot rely on the
hash function being called for every lookup or update.  Furthermore any
hashtable operation may call the hash function more than once.
