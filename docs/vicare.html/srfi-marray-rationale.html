This document describes version 0.3d0 of Vicare Scheme, an
R6RS compliant native compiler for the Scheme language, producing
single threaded programs running on Intel x86 32-bit processors, with
experimental support for 64-bit machines.  _Vicare_ is pronounced
the etruscan way.

<h4 class="subsection">11.13.2 Rationale</h4>

<p>The proposed arrays encourage a natural declarative programming style. 
They allow sharing of most any rectangular part of an array through an
affine index mapping, without copying.  But imperative style is equally
natural.

   <p>The design is consistent with the two indexed data structures of Scheme:
vectors and strings.  The design makes arrays a self&ndash;contained type. 
These statements are illustrated in the following paragraphs.

   <p>First, in the one&ndash;dimensional case, the arguments of the following
relevant calls match exactly.

<pre class="example">     (vector-set! v k o)
     (string-set! s k c)
     (array-set! a k o)
</pre>
   <p>Likewise, <code>make-array</code> matches <code>make-vector</code> and
<code>make-string</code>.  An analogue to <code>vector</code>, <code>string</code> and
<code>list</code> is provided, alleviating the lack of an external
representation.  Index bounds are specified as for <code>substring</code>,
lower bound included and upper bound excluded.

   <p>Array shapes are specified as arrays.  These can be made with a special
procedure <code>shape</code> that does not have a shape argument.  An array
does not retain a dependence to the shape array.  For example, mutation
of a shape array is allowed.

   <p>Index mappings return multiple values as multiple values.

   <p>Array dimensions can begin at any index. In particular, the choice
between <code>0</code> and <code>1</code> is left to the user.  (Shapes and index
objects are zero based, though.)

   <p>The ability to pack an index sequence in a vector is useful for
implementing higher level operations.  (The ability to pack it in a
one&ndash;dimensional array lets one use, say, a row of a matrix as an
index.)

   <p>It is not required that vectors not be arrays.  It is not required that
they be, either.
