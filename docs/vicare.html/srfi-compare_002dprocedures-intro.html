<h4 class="subsection">11.28.3 Introduction</h4>

<p>This <acronym>SRFI</acronym> defines a mechanism for comparing Scheme values with
respect to a total order (aka linear order) [1].  The mechanism provides
operations for:

     <ol type=1 start=1>
<li>Comparing objects of the built in types.

     <li>Using a total order in situations that arise in programs.

     <li>Facilitating the definition of a new total order.
        </ol>

   <p>In the following, these aspects will briefly be illustrated.

   <p>Traditionally, a total order is represented in Scheme by an order
predicate, like <code>&lt;</code> or <code>char&lt;?</code>.  For the purpose of this
<acronym>SRFI</acronym>, however, a total order is represented by a Scheme&ndash;procedure
comparing its two arguments and returning either <code>-1</code>, <code>0</code>, or
<code>+1</code> depending on whether the first argument is considered smaller,
equal, or greater than the second argument respectively.  Examples of
such compare procedures include:

<pre class="example">     (lambda (x y) (sign (- x y)))
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">for comparing real numbers, but also:

<pre class="example">     (lambda (x y) 0)
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">comparing anything.  For most built in types specified in the Revised5
Report on the Algorithmic Language Scheme (<acronym>R5RS</acronym>, [3]) compare
procedures are specified in Sections of this <acronym>SRFI</acronym>.  An axiomatic
definition of &ldquo;compare procedure&rdquo; is given in another section.

   <p>The primary reason for using 3-valued compare procedures instead of
(2-valued) order predicates is efficiency: When comparison is
computationally expensive, it is wasteful if two predicates are
evaluated where a single 3-valued comparison would suffice.  This point
is discussed in greater detail in a section.

   <p>But dealing directly with 3-valued comparisons in the application
program is inconvenient and obscures intention: For testing x &lt; y
one would have to write:

<pre class="example">     (eqv? (compare x y) -1)
</pre>
   <p>For this reason, an operation <code>&lt;?</code> is supplied which allows to
phrase the same test as:

<pre class="example">     (&lt;?  compare x y)
</pre>
   <p>This is an example of mapping the three possible outcomes of a
comparison into the two boolean values <code>{#f, #t}</code>.  Since
<code>&lt;?</code> takes the total order as an explicit parameter, a comfortably
large arsenal of tests can be made available for each and every total
order.  This deviates from the approach of <acronym>R5RS</acronym>, in which there are
only five operations (<code>=</code>, <code>&lt;</code>, <code>&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;=</code>,
<code>&gt;=</code>)&mdash;and for each total order (<code>real</code>/<code>number</code>,
<code>char</code>, <code>char-ci</code>, <code>string</code>, <code>string-ci</code>) a complete
set of these five operation is provided.

   <p>But still, using <code>&lt;?</code> would be inconvenient if the compare
procedure would have to be supplied explicitly every time.  For this
reason, the parameter compare is often made optional in this
<acronym>SRFI</acronym>&mdash;and the procedure <code>default-compare</code> is used whenever no
compare procedure is passed explicitly.  <code>default-compare</code> defines
some resonable total order on the built in types of <acronym>R5RS</acronym>.

   <p>For the third aspect of this <acronym>SRFI</acronym>, defining compare procedures,
special control structures (macros) are provided.  These control
structures can be used in the definition of a (potentially recursive)
compare procedure.  This is best explained by an extended example.

<h5 class="subsubheading">Example</h5>

<p>Assume there is a type length representing physical length.  The type
has an accessor procedure meters returning the length in meters (a real
number).  A compare procedure for lengths can then be defined in terms
of <code>real-compare</code> as:

<pre class="example">     (define (length-compare length1 length2)
       (real-compare (meters length1) (meters length2)))
</pre>
   <p>Now,

<pre class="example">     (&lt;? length-compare x y)
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">tests if length <var>x</var> is shorter than length <var>y</var>.  Also,

<pre class="example">     (&lt;=/&lt;? length-compare a x b)
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">tests if length <var>x</var> lies between length <var>a</var> (inclusive) and
length <var>b</var> (exclusive).  The expression:

<pre class="example">     (min-compare length-compare x y z)
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">is a shortest of the lengths <var>x</var>, <var>y</var>, and <var>z</var>.  Likewise,

<pre class="example">     (chain&lt;? length-compare x1 x2 x3 x4)
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">tests if the lengths <var>x1</var>, <var>x2</var>, <var>x3</var>, <var>x4</var> are strictly
increasing, and so on.

   <p>Furthermore, assume there is another type box representing a physical
box.  The type has procedures width, height, and depth accessing the
dimension (each giving a length).  A compare procedure for boxes,
comparing first by width then by height and then by depth, can be
defined using the control structure <code>refine-compare</code> as:

<pre class="example">     (define (box-compare box1 box2)
       (refine-compare
         (length-compare (width  box1) (width  box2))
         (length-compare (height box1) (height box2))
         (length-compare (depth  box1) (depth  box2))))
</pre>
   <p>This time,

<pre class="example">     (&lt;? box-compare b1 b2)
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">tests if box <var>b1</var> is smaller than box <var>b2</var>&mdash;in the sense of the
order defined.  Of course, all the other tests, minimum, maximum
etc. are available, too.

   <p>As a final complication, assume that there is also a type <code>bowl</code>
with accessors <code>radius</code> (a length) and <code>open?</code> (a boolean). 
Bowls are to be compared first by whether they are open or closed, and
then by radius.  However, bowls and boxes also need to be compared to
each other, ordered such that a bowl is considered &ldquo;smaller&rdquo; than a
box.  (There are type-test predicates <code>box?</code> and <code>bowl?</code>). 
Using the control structure <code>select-compare</code> this can be expressed
as:

<pre class="example">     (define (container-compare c1 c2)
       (select-compare c1 c2
         (bowl? (boolean-compare (open?  c1) (open?  c2))
                (length-compare  (radius c1) (radius c2)))
         (box?  (box-compare c1 c2))
         (else "neither bowls nor boxes" c1 c2)))
</pre>
   <p>This is an example of &ldquo;hierarchical extension&rdquo; of compare procedures. 
Also note the implicit use of <code>refine-compare</code> in the <code>bowl?</code>
case.

   <p>The preceeding example illustrates the main functionality of this
<acronym>SRFI</acronym>.
