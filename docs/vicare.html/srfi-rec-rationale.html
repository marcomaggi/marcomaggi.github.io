<h4 class="subsection">10.18.3 Rationale</h4>

<h4 class="subheading">General</h4>

<p>Among the prominent features of the Scheme programming language as
defined in [KCR1998] are the following:

     <ul>
<li>it has simple syntax;

     <li>it encourages recursive definitions, e.g. by ensuring memory efficient
tail recursion;

     <li>it supports non&ndash;imperative programming. 
</ul>

   <p>Nevertheless Scheme does not provide a syntax for recursive evaluations
with the properties of:

     <ul>
<li>being as simple, intuitive and close to the mathematical standard
notation as possible;

     <li>allowing general recursion;

     <li>being non&ndash;imperative. 
</ul>

<!--  -->
<h4 class="subheading">Example</h4>

<h5 class="subsubheading">Problem 1</h5>

<p class="noindent">Let us look at the factorial function.  In mathematical notation this
function is expressed as:

<pre class="example">     (F : N |--&gt; 1,            if N = 0;
                 N * F(N - 1), otherwise
</pre>
   <p>This expression is a term and not a definition or proposition.

   <p>We investigate some approaches to express the factorial function in
Scheme.

     <ul>
<li>The simplest way perhaps is as:

     <pre class="example">          (define (F N)
            (if (zero? N)
                1
              (* N (F (- N 1)))))
</pre>
     <p>But this expression is not a term.  It binds the factorial function to
the variable <var>f</var>.  The expression itself may not occur in a
syntactical context where a name of the factorial is required.

     <li>We list several ways to express the factorial as a function term.

          <ol type=1 start=1>
<li>
          <pre class="example">               (let ()
                 (define (F N)
                   (if (zero? N)
                       1
                     (* N (F (- N 1)))))
                     F)
</pre>
          <li>
          <pre class="example">               (lambda (N)
                 (let F ([N N])
                   (if (zero? N)
                       1
                     (* N (F (- N 1))))))
</pre>
          <li>
          <pre class="example">               (letrec ([F (lambda (N)
                             (if (zero? N)
                                 1
                               (* N (F (- N 1)))))])
                 F)
</pre>
          <li>
          <pre class="example">               ((lambda (F)
                  (F F))
                (lambda (G)
                  (lambda (N)
                    (if (zero? N)
                        1
                      (* N ((G G) (- N 1)))))))
</pre>
          </ol>

     <p>All these expressions define the factorial anonymously, not binding it
to a variable.  However, all these expressions are more verbose than it
seems necessary and they are less intuitive than it seems desirable. 
</ul>

<h5 class="subsubheading">Solution 1</h5>

<p class="noindent">A solution to our problem was already provided in [Clinger1985] by the
form <code>named-lambda</code>.  An even earlier solution with a slightly
different syntax was implemented in Kent Dybvig's Chez Scheme system. 
Using this special form, we can denote the factorial simply by:

<pre class="example">     (named-lambda (F N)
       (if (zero? N)
           1
         (* N (F (- N 1)))))
</pre>
   <p>This expression is a function term that denotes the factorial in the
appropriate brevity.

   <p>However, the form <code>named-lambda</code> has been dropped from later
versions of the Scheme Report.  Also it is missing in
state&ndash;of&ndash;the&ndash;art implementations such as Chez Scheme (6.0a) and
<acronym>MIT</acronym> Scheme (7.7.0).  (The latter actually knows a form
<code>named-lambda</code> with different semantics.)

<!--  -->
<h5 class="subsubheading">Problem 2</h5>

<p class="noindent">The constant stream of ones can be defined via:

<pre class="example">     (define S (cons 1 (delay S)))
</pre>
   <p>As in the case of the factorial, we are able to define the recursive
object at the price of spending an externally bound name.  Remedying
this with let or letrec leads to similar objections as above.

<h5 class="subsubheading">Solution 2</h5>

<p class="noindent">This particular case of the self&ndash;referential problem was solved by the
<code>rec</code> form in [Clinger1985].  This form allows writing:

<pre class="example">     (rec S (cons 1 (delay S)))
</pre>
   <p>This expression is non&ndash;imperative and does not introduce an external
variable binding.

   <p>Also this form has been dropped from later versions of the Scheme
Report.  Moreover, from our point of view this form alone is not capable
of solving Problem 1.  The respective definition would look like:

<pre class="example">     (rec F
       (lambda (N)
         (if (zero? N)
             1
           (* N (F (- N 1))))))
</pre>
   <p>This again does not seem quite as simple and intuitive as the
mathematical notation.

<!--  -->
<h4 class="subheading">Proposal</h4>

<p class="noindent">We therefore propose to implement the <code>rec</code> special form in a
generalized way that combines the advantages of the <code>named-lambda</code>
and <code>rec</code> forms.  The factorial function could be written:

<pre class="example">     (rec (F N)
       (if (zero? N)
           1
         (* N (F (- N 1)))))
</pre>
