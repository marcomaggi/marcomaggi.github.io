<h2 class="appendix">Appendix I History</h2>

<p>The original version of this document is by Abdulaziz Ghuloum, who wrote
it in the years 2006-2010, under the title &ldquo;Ikarus Scheme User's
Guide&rdquo;.

   <p>In 2008 the original document in TeX format was transformed in Texinfo
format by Marco Maggi.

   <p>Starting with 2010 the Texinfo document was renamed to &ldquo;Vicare Scheme&rdquo;
and further developed to be the users's and developer's guide for Vicare
Scheme, a fork of the original Ikarus Scheme.

   <p>The documentation of the <acronym>SRFI</acronym> libraries was written by the original
<acronym>SRFI</acronym> authors, transformed to Texinfo format and adapted for inclusion
in this document.
