This document describes version 0.3d4 of Vicare Scheme, an
R6RS compliant native compiler for the Scheme language, producing
single threaded programs running on Intel x86 32-bit processors, with
experimental support for 64-bit machines.  _Vicare_ is pronounced
the etruscan way.

<h4 class="subsection">14.31.3 Rationale</h4>

<p>Most operating systems provide a mechanism for passing auxiliary
parameters implicitly to child processes.  Usually, this mechanism is
called &ldquo;the environment&rdquo;, and is conceptually a map from string names
to string values.  The string names are called environment variables.

   <p>Some applications rely on environment variables to modify their behavior
according to local settings.  Also, various established protocols rely
on environment variables as a form of interprocess communication.  For
example, most implementations of the common gateway interface
(<acronym>CGI</acronym>) use environment variables to pass Meta&ndash;Variables from
the server to the script.  Environment variables are also required by
<acronym>SRFI</acronym>-96 <acronym>SLIB</acronym> Prerequisites.  Providing a means to access
environment variables is therefore indispensable for writing practical
programs in Scheme.

   <p>Most widely&ndash;used Scheme implementations provide a function for getting
the value of a specified environment variable.  The name for this
function is usually getenv, but varies (see below).  Some
implementations also provide a way to get all the environment variables,
but others do not.

   <p>This <acronym>SRFI</acronym> specifies a uniform interface for accessing environment
variables.  That should make it easier to write portable programs that
need access to their environment.  For example, a <acronym>CGI</acronym> program
may portably obtain the values of the Meta&ndash;Variables
<samp><span class="env">QUERY_STRING</span></samp>, <samp><span class="env">CONTENT_LENGTH</span></samp> and <samp><span class="env">REQUEST_METHOD</span></samp> as in
the following examples:

<pre class="example">     (get-environment-variable "QUERY_STRING") =&gt; "foo=bar&amp;huga=hige"
     (get-environment-variable "CONTENT_LENGTH") =&gt; "512"
     (get-environment-variable "REQUEST_METHOD") =&gt; "post"
</pre>
