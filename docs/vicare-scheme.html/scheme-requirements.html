<h3 class="section">3.2 Requirement levels</h3>

<p>The key words &ldquo;must&rdquo;, &ldquo;must not&rdquo;, &ldquo;should&rdquo;, &ldquo;should not&rdquo;,
&ldquo;recommended&rdquo;, &ldquo;may&rdquo;, and &ldquo;optional&rdquo; in this report are to be
interpreted as described in <acronym>RFC</acronym> 2119.  Specifically:

     <dl>
<dt><strong>must</strong><dd>This word means that a statement is an absolute requirement of the
specification.

     <br><dt><strong>must not</strong><dd>This phrase means that a statement is an absolute prohibition of the
specification.

     <br><dt><strong>should</strong><dd>This word, or the adjective &ldquo;recommended&rdquo;, means that valid reasons
may exist in particular circumstances to ignore a statement, but that
the implications must be understood and weighed before choosing a
different course.

     <br><dt><strong>should not</strong><dd>This phrase, or the phrase &ldquo;not recommended&rdquo;, means that valid reasons
may exist in particular circumstances when the behavior of a statement
is acceptable, but that the implications should be understood and
weighed before choosing the course described by the statement.

     <br><dt><strong>may</strong><dd>This word, or the adjective &ldquo;optional&rdquo;, means that an item is truly
optional. 
</dl>

   <p>In particular, this report occasionally uses &ldquo;should&rdquo; to designate
circumstances that are outside the specification of this report, but
cannot be practically detected by an implementation.  <a href="scheme-basic-argument-checking.html#scheme-basic-argument-checking">Arguments checking</a>.  In such circumstances, a
particular implementation may allow the programmer to ignore the
recommendation of the report and even exhibit reasonable behavior. 
However, as the report does not specify the behavior, these programs may
be unportable, that is, their execution might produce different results
on different implementations.

   <p>Moreover, this report occasionally uses the phrase &ldquo;not required&rdquo; to
note the absence of an absolute requirement.
