This document describes version 0.3d2 of Vicare Scheme, an
R6RS compliant native compiler for the Scheme language, producing
single threaded programs running on Intel x86 32-bit processors, with
experimental support for 64-bit machines.  _Vicare_ is pronounced
the etruscan way.

<h4 class="subsection">14.19.3 Rationale</h4>

<p>The <em>dynamic environment</em> is the structure which allows the system
to find the value returned by the <acronym>R5RS</acronym> procedures
<code>current-input-port</code> and <code>current-output-port</code>.  The <acronym>R5RS</acronym>
procedures <code>with-input-from-file</code> and <code>with-output-to-file</code>
extend the dynamic environment to produce a new dynamic environment
which is in effect for the dynamic extent of the call to the thunk
passed as their last argument.

   <p>These procedures are essentially special purpose dynamic binding
operations on hidden dynamic variables (one for
<code>current-input-port</code> and one for <code>current-output-port</code>).  The
purpose of this <acronym>SRFI</acronym> is to generalize this dynamic binding mechanism
(which exists in all <acronym>R5RS</acronym> compliant systems) to allow the user to
introduce new dynamic variables and dynamically bind them.

   <p>General dynamic binding mechanisms exist in several implementations of
Scheme under various names, including &ldquo;fluid&rdquo; variables and parameter
objects.  The parameter objects specified in this <acronym>SRFI</acronym> are
compatible with the semantics of all implementations of Scheme we know
which currently support parameter objects (in the sense that it is
possible to implement this <acronym>SRFI</acronym> so that old code works the same as
before).  We believe Chez&ndash;Scheme was the first implementation of Scheme
to have used parameter objects.

   <p>In the presence of threads, the dynamic binding mechanism does not
behave the same way in all implementations of Scheme supporting dynamic
binding.  The issue is the relationship between the dynamic environments
of the parent and child threads when a thread is created.  In Scheme 48
the child gets a fresh dynamic environment where (typically but not
necessarily) all the bindings are to their initial value.

   <p>In MzScheme and Gambit&ndash;C the child is given a dynamic environment
inherited from the parent.  In this inherited dynamic environment the
dynamic variables have the same values as the parent's dynamic
environment.  However, in MzScheme the cells bound to the dynamic
variables in the child are distinct from those of the parent (i.e. an
assignment of a value to a dynamic variable is not visible in the other
thread).  In Gambit&ndash;C the child and parent dynamic environment share
the same cells (i.e. an assignment of a value to a dynamic variable is
visible in the other thread).  Note that in the absence of assignment to
dynamic variables the MzScheme and Gambit&ndash;C approaches are equivalent.

   <p>Given that there are semantic differences in the presence of threads and
that there are valid reasons for choosing each semantics, this <acronym>SRFI</acronym>
does not specify the semantics of parameter objects in the presence of
threads.  It is left to the implementation and other <acronym>SRFI</acronym>s which
extend this <acronym>SRFI</acronym> to specify the interaction between parameter
objects and threads.
