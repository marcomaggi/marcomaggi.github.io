This document describes version 0.3d7 of Vicare Scheme, an
R6RS compliant native compiler for the Scheme language, producing
single threaded programs running on Intel x86 32-bit processors, with
experimental support for 64-bit machines.  _Vicare_ is pronounced
the etruscan way.

<h4 class="subsection">3.5.4 Argument checking</h4>

<p>Many procedures specified in this report or as part of a standard
library restrict the arguments they accept.  Typically, a procedure
accepts only specific numbers and types of arguments.  Many syntactic
forms similarly restrict the values to which one or more of their
subforms can evaluate.  These restrictions imply responsibilities for
both the programmer and the implementation.  Specifically, the
programmer is responsible for ensuring that the values indeed adhere to
the restrictions described in the specification.  The implementation
must check that the restrictions in the specification are indeed met, to
the extent that it is reasonable, possible, and necessary to allow the
specified operation to complete successfully.

   <p>Note that it is not always possible for an implementation to completely
check the restrictions set forth in a specification.  For example, if an
operation is specified to accept a procedure with specific properties,
checking of these properties is undecidable in general.  Similarly, some
operations accept both lists and procedures that are called by these
operations.  Since lists can be mutated by the procedures through the
<code>(rnrs mutable-pairs (6))</code> library, an argument that is a list when the
operation starts may become a non&ndash;list during the execution of the
operation.

   <p>Also, the procedure might escape to a different continuation, preventing
the operation from performing more checks.  Requiring the operation to
check that the argument is a list after each call to such a procedure
would be impractical.  Furthermore, some operations that accept lists
only need to traverse these lists partially to perform their function;
requiring the implementation to traverse the remainder of the list to
verify that all specified restrictions have been met might violate
reasonable performance assumptions.  For these reasons, the programmer's
obligations may exceed the checking obligations of the implementation.

   <p>When an implementation detects a violation of a restriction for an
argument, it must raise an exception with condition type
<code>&amp;assertion</code> in a way consistent with the safety of execution as
described in section &ldquo;Safety&rdquo;.
