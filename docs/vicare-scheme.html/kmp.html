This document describes version 0.3d4 of Vicare Scheme, an
R6RS compliant native compiler for the Scheme language, producing
single threaded programs running on Intel x86 32-bit processors, with
experimental support for 64-bit machines.  _Vicare_ is pronounced
the etruscan way.

<h2 class="chapter">22 Knuth&ndash;Morris&ndash;Pratt searching</h2>

<p><a name="index-g_t_0040library_007bvicare-containers-knuth_002dmorris_002dpratt_007d_002c-library-7769"></a><a name="index-Library-_0040library_007bvicare-containers-knuth_002dmorris_002dpratt_007d-7770"></a>

   <p>The Knuth&ndash;Morris&ndash;Pratt (<acronym>KMP</acronym>) sequence&ndash;search algorithm is a
method of rapidly scanning a sequence of values for the occurrence of
some fixed pattern.  It has the advantage of never requiring
backtracking; hence, it is useful for searching sequences that do not
support backtracking or random&ndash;access, such as input ports.

   <p>For an explanation of the algorithm:

<div align="center"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knuth-Morris-Pratt_algorithm">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knuth-Morris-Pratt_algorithm</a></div>

   <p>The following routines package up the initialisation and searching
phases of the algorithm for general use in the library <code>(vicare
containers knuth-morris-pratt)</code>.  They also support searching through
sequences that arrive in buffered chunks, in that intermediate search
state can be carried across applications of the search loop from the end
of one buffer application to the next.

   <p>A second critical property of <acronym>KMP</acronym> search is that it requires
the allocation of auxiliary memory proportional to the length of the
pattern, but constant in the size of the value type.  Alternate
searching algorithms frequently require the construction of a table with
an entry for every possible value, which can be prohibitively expensive,
for example, in a 16-bit or 32-bit character representation.

   <p>The algorithm is especially suited to search patterns of characters in
text, so many examples are given for strings.  However the library
supports searching any values in any sequence.
