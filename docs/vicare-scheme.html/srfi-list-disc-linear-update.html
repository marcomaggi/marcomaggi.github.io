R6RS compliant native compiler for the Scheme language, producing
single threaded programs running on Intel x86 32-bit processors, with
experimental support for 64-bit machines.  _Vicare_ is pronounced
the etruscan way.

<h5 class="subsubsection">14.2.4.2 &ldquo;Linear update&rdquo; procedures</h5>

<p>Many procedures in this library have &ldquo;pure&rdquo; and &ldquo;linear update&rdquo;
variants.  A &ldquo;pure&rdquo; procedure has no side&ndash;effects, and in particular
does not alter its arguments in any way.  A &ldquo;linear update&rdquo; procedure
is allowed, but not required, to side&ndash;effect its arguments in order to
construct its result.  &ldquo;Linear update&rdquo; procedures are typically given
names ending with an exclamation point.

   <p>So, for example, <code>(append!  list1 list2)</code> is allowed to construct
its result by simply using <code>set-cdr!</code> to set the cdr of the last
pair of <var>list1</var> to point to <var>list2</var>, and then returning
<var>list1</var> (unless <var>list1</var> is the empty list, in which case it
would simply return <var>list2</var>).  However, <code>append!</code> may also
elect to perform a pure append operation, this is a legal definition of
append!:

<pre class="example">     (define append! append)
</pre>
   <p>This is why we do not call these procedures &ldquo;destructive&rdquo;, because
they aren't required to be destructive.  They are <em>potentially</em>
destructive.

   <p>What this means is that you may only apply linear&ndash;update procedures to
values that you know are &ldquo;dead&rdquo;, values that will never be used again
in your program.  This must be so, since you can't rely on the value
passed to a linear&ndash;update procedure after that procedure has been
called.  It might be unchanged; it might be altered.

   <p>The &ldquo;linear&rdquo; in &ldquo;linear update&rdquo; doesn't mean &ldquo;linear time&rdquo; or
&ldquo;linear space&rdquo; or any sort of multiple&ndash;of&ndash;n kind of meaning.  It's a
fancy term that type theorists and pure functional programmers use to
describe systems where you are only allowed to have exactly one
reference to each variable.  This provides a guarantee that the value
bound to a variable is bound to no other variable.  So when you use a
variable in a variable reference, you &ldquo;use it up&rdquo;.  Knowing that no
one else has a pointer to that value means the a system primitive is
free to side&ndash;effect its arguments to produce what is, observationally,
a pure&ndash;functional result.

   <p>In the context of this library, &ldquo;linear update&rdquo; means you, the
programmer, know there are no other live references to the value passed
to the procedure; after passing the value to one of these procedures,
the value of the old pointer is indeterminate.  Basically, you are
licensing the Scheme implementation to alter the data structure if it
feels like it; you have declared you don't care either way.

   <p>You get no help from Scheme in checking that the values you claim are
&ldquo;linear&rdquo; really are.  So you better get it right.  Or play it safe and
use the non&ndash;<code>!</code> procedures; it doesn't do any good to compute
quickly if you get the wrong answer.

   <p>Why go to all this trouble to define the notion of &ldquo;linear update&rdquo; and
use it in a procedure spec, instead of the more common notion of a
&ldquo;destructive&rdquo; operation?

   <p>First, note that destructive list&ndash;processing procedures are almost
always used in a linear&ndash;update fashion.  This is in part required by
the special case of operating upon the empty list, which can't be
side&ndash;effected.  This means that destructive operators are not pure
side&ndash;effects, they have to return a result.

   <p>Second, note that code written using linear&ndash;update operators can be
trivially ported to a pure, functional subset of Scheme by simply
providing pure implementations of the linear&ndash;update operators.

   <p>Finally, requiring destructive side&ndash;effects ruins opportunities to
parallelise these operations, and the places where one has taken the
trouble to spell out destructive operations are usually exactly the code
one would want a parallelising compiler to parallelise: the
efficiency&ndash;critical kernels of the algorithm.

   <p>Linear&ndash;update operations are easily parallelised.  Going with a
linear&ndash;update spec doesn't close off these valuable alternative
implementation techniques.  This list library is intended as a set of
low&ndash;level, basic operators, so we don't want to exclude these possible
implementations.

   <p>The linear&ndash;update procedures in this library are:

<pre class="example">     alist-delete!           append!
     append-map!             append-reverse!
     break!                  concatenate!
     delete!                 delete-duplicates!
     drop-right!             filter!
     lset-adjoin!            lset-diff+intersection!
     lset-difference!        lset-xor!
     lset-intersection!      lset-union!
     map!                    partition!
     remove!                 reverse!
     span!                   split-at!
     take!                   take-while!
