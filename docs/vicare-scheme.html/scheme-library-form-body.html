<h4 class="subsubsection">3.7.1.7 Library bodies</h4>


<p>The <var>?library-body</var> of a <code>library</code> form consists of forms that
are classified as <em>definitions</em> or <em>expressions</em>.  Which forms
belong to which class depends on the imported libraries and the result
of expansion.  Generally, forms that are not definitions are
expressions.
</p>
<p>A <var>?library-body</var> is like a <var>?body</var> except that a
<var>?library-body</var>s need not include any expressions.  It must have the
following form:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example"><var>?definition</var> &hellip; <var>?expression</var> &hellip;
</pre></div>

<p>When <code>begin</code>, <code>let-syntax</code>, or <code>letrec-syntax</code> forms
occur in a top&ndash;level body prior to the first expression, they are
spliced into the body.  Some or all of the body, including portions
wrapped in <code>begin</code>, <code>let-syntax</code>, or <code>letrec-syntax</code>
forms, may be specified by a syntactic abstraction.
</p>
<p>The transformer expressions and bindings are evaluated and created from
left to right, as described in <a href="scheme-expansion.html#scheme-expansion">Expansion process</a>
The expressions of variable definitions are evaluated from left to
right, as if in an implicit <code>letrec*</code>, and the body expressions are
also evaluated from left to right after the expressions of the variable
definitions.  A fresh location is created for each exported variable and
initialized to the value of its local counterpart.  The effect of
returning twice to the continuation of the last body expression is
unspecified.
</p>

<p><strong>NOTE</strong> The names &lsquo;<samp>library</samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp>export</samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp>import</samp>&rsquo;,
&lsquo;<samp>for</samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp>run</samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp>expand</samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp>meta</samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp>import</samp>&rsquo;,
&lsquo;<samp>export</samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp>only</samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp>except</samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp>prefix</samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp>rename</samp>&rsquo;,
&lsquo;<samp>and</samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp>or</samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp>not</samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp>&gt;=</samp>&rsquo;, and &lsquo;<samp>&lt;=</samp>&rsquo; appearing in
the library syntax are part of the syntax and are not reserved, i.e.,
the same names can be used for other purposes within the library or even
exported from or imported into a library with different meanings,
without affecting their use in the <code>library</code> form.
</p></blockquote>

<p>Bindings defined with a library are not visible in code outside of the
library, unless the bindings are explicitly exported from the library.
An exported macro may, however, <em>implicitly export</em> an otherwise
unexported identifier defined within or imported into the library.  That
is, it may insert a reference to that identifier into the output code it
produces.
</p>
<p>All explicitly exported variables are immutable in both the exporting
and importing libraries.  It is thus a syntax violation if an explicitly
exported variable appears on the left&ndash;hand side of a <code>set!</code>
expression, either in the exporting or importing libraries.
</p>
<p>All implicitly exported variables are also immutable in both the
exporting and importing libraries.  It is thus a syntax violation if a
variable appears on the left&ndash;hand side of a <code>set!</code>  expression in
any code produced by an exported macro outside of the library in which
the variable is defined.  It is also a syntax violation if a reference
to an assigned variable appears in any code produced by an exported
macro outside of the library in which the variable is defined, where an
assigned variable is one that appears on the left&ndash;hand side of a
<code>set!</code> expression in the exporting library.
</p>
<p>All other variables defined within a library are mutable.
