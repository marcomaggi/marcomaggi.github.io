experimental support for 64-bit machines.  _Vicare_ is pronounced
the etruscan way.

<h3 class="section">4.14 Control features</h3>

<p>This chapter describes various primitive procedures which control the
flow of program execution in special ways.

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Procedure: <b>apply</b><var> proc arg1 <small class="dots">...</small> rest-args<a name="index-apply-328"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p><var>rest-args</var> must be a list.  <var>proc</var> should accept <em>n</em>
arguments, where <em>n</em> is number of <var>arg</var>s plus the length of
<var>rest-args</var>.  The <code>apply</code> procedure calls <var>proc</var> with the
elements of the list:

     <pre class="example">          (append (list <var>arg1</var> ...) <var>rest-args</var>)
</pre>
        <p class="noindent">as the actual arguments.

        <p>If a call to <code>apply</code> occurs in a tail context, the call to
<var>proc</var> is also in a tail context.

     <pre class="example">          (apply + (list 3 4))                    &rArr;  7
          
          (define compose
            (lambda (f g)
              (lambda args
                (f (apply g args)))))
          
          ((compose sqrt *) 12 75)                &rArr;  30

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Procedure: <b>call-with-current-continuation</b><var> proc<a name="index-call_002dwith_002dcurrent_002dcontinuation-329"></a></var><br>
&mdash; Procedure: <b>call/cc</b><var> proc<a name="index-call_002fcc-330"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p><var>proc</var> should accept one argument.  The procedure <code>call/cc</code>
(which is the same as the procedure
<code>call-with-current-continuation</code>) packages the current continuation
as an &ldquo;escape procedure&rdquo; and passes it as an argument to <var>proc</var>.

        <p>The escape procedure is a Scheme procedure that, if it is later called,
will abandon whatever continuation is in effect at that later time and
will instead reinstate the continuation that was in effect when the
escape procedure was created.

        <p>Calling the escape procedure may cause the invocation of <var>before</var>
and <var>after</var> procedures installed using <code>dynamic-wind</code>.

        <p>The escape procedure accepts the same number of arguments as the
continuation of the original call to <code>call/cc</code>.

        <p>The escape procedure that is passed to <var>proc</var> has unlimited extent
just like any other procedure in Scheme.  It may be stored in variables
or data structures and may be called as many times as desired.

        <p>If a call to <code>call/cc</code> occurs in a tail context, the call to
<var>proc</var> is also in a tail context.

        <p>The following examples show only some ways in which <code>call/cc</code> is
used.  If all real uses were as simple as these examples, there would be
no need for a procedure with the power of <code>call/cc</code>.

     <pre class="example">          (call-with-current-continuation
            (lambda (exit)
              (for-each (lambda (x)

                              (exit x)))
                        '(54 0 37 -3 245 19))
              #t))

                  (letrec ((r
                            (lambda (obj)
                              (cond ((null? obj) 0)
                                    ((pair? obj)
                                     (+ (r (cdr obj)) 1))
                                    (else (return #f))))))
                    (r obj))))))
          
          (list-length '(1 2 3 4))                        &rArr;  4
          (list-length '(a b . c))                        &rArr; #f

<blockquote><p>Delivers all of its arguments to its continuation.  The <code>values</code>
procedure might be defined as follows:

     <pre class="example">          (define (values . things)

<code>let*</code>, <code>letrec</code>, <code>letrec*</code>, <code>let-values</code>,
<code>let*-values</code>, <code>case</code>, and <code>cond</code> forms, usually take an
arbitrary number of values.

        <p>Except for these and the continuations created by
<code>call-with-values</code>, <code>let-values</code>, and <code>let*-values</code>,
continuations implicitly accepting a single value, such as the
continuations of <var>?operator</var> and <var>?operand</var>s of procedure calls
or the <var>?test</var> expressions in conditionals, take exactly one value. 
The effect of passing an inappropriate number of values to such a
continuation is undefined.

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Procedure: <b>call-with-values</b><var> producer consumer<a name="index-call_002dwith_002dvalues-332"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p><var>producer</var> must be a procedure and should accept zero arguments. 
<var>consumer</var> must be a procedure and should accept as many values as
<var>producer</var> returns.  The <code>call-with-values</code> procedure calls
<var>producer</var> with no arguments and a continuation that, when passed
some values, calls the <var>consumer</var> procedure with those values as
arguments.  The continuation for the call to <var>consumer</var> is the
continuation of the call to <code>call-with-values</code>.

     <pre class="example">          (call-with-values
              (lambda () (values 4 5))
            (lambda (a b) b))

          (call-with-values * -)
          &rArr;  -1
</pre>
        <p>If a call to <code>call-with-values</code> occurs in a tail context, the call
to <var>consumer</var> is also in a tail context.

        <p><strong>Implementation responsibilities:</strong> After <var>producer</var> returns,
the implementation must check that <var>consumer</var> accepts as many values
as <var>consumer</var> has returned. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Procedure: <b>dynamic-wind</b><var> before thunk after<a name="index-dynamic_002dwind-333"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p><var>before</var>, <var>thunk</var>, and <var>after</var> must be procedures, and each
should accept zero arguments.  These procedures may return any number of
values.

        <p>The <code>dynamic-wind</code> procedure calls <var>thunk</var> without arguments,
returning the results of this call.  Moreover, <code>dynamic-wind</code> calls
<var>before</var> without arguments whenever the dynamic extent of the call
to <var>thunk</var> is entered, and <var>after</var> without arguments whenever
the dynamic extent of the call to <var>thunk</var> is exited.  Thus, in the
absence of calls to escape procedures created by <code>call/cc</code>,
<code>dynamic-wind</code> calls <var>before</var>, <var>thunk</var>, and <var>after</var>, in
that order.

        <p>While the calls to <var>before</var> and <var>after</var> are not considered to be
within the dynamic extent of the call to <var>thunk</var>, calls to the
<var>before</var> and <var>after</var> procedures of any other calls to
<code>dynamic-wind</code> that occur within the dynamic extent of the call to
<var>thunk</var> are considered to be within the dynamic extent of the call
to <var>thunk</var>.

        <p>More precisely, an escape procedure transfers control out of the dynamic
extent of a set of zero or more active <code>dynamic-wind</code> calls <em>x
<small class="dots">...</small></em> and transfer control into the dynamic extent of a set of zero
or more active <code>dynamic-wind</code> calls <em>y <small class="dots">...</small></em>.  It leaves
the dynamic extent of the most recent <em>x</em> and calls without
arguments the corresponding <var>after</var> procedure.  If the <var>after</var>
procedure returns, the escape procedure proceeds to the next most recent
<em>x</em>, and so on.  Once each <em>x</em> has been handled in this
manner, the escape procedure calls without arguments the <var>before</var>
procedure corresponding to the least recent <em>y</em>.  If the
<var>before</var> procedure returns, the escape procedure reenters the
dynamic extent of the least recent <em>y</em> and proceeds with the next
least recent <em>y</em>, and so on.  Once each <em>y</em> has been handled
in this manner, control is transferred to the continuation packaged in
the escape procedure.

        <p><strong>Implementation responsibilities:</strong> The implementation must check
the restrictions on <var>thunk</var> and <var>after</var> only if they are
actually called.
