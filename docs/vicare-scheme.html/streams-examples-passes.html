This document describes version 0.3d4 of Vicare Scheme, an
R6RS compliant native compiler for the Scheme language, producing
single threaded programs running on Intel x86 32-bit processors, with
experimental support for 64-bit machines.  _Vicare_ is pronounced
the etruscan way.

<h5 class="subsubsection">15.14.14.5 Reducing two passes to one</h5>

<p>The final example is a lazy dictionary, where definitions and uses may
occur in any order; in particular, uses may precede their corresponding
definitions.  This is a common problem.

   <p>Many programming languages allow procedures to be used before they are
defined.  Macro processors must collect definitions and emit uses of
text in order.  An assembler needs to know the address that a linker
will subsequently give to variables.  The usual method is to make two
passes over the data, collecting the definitions on the first pass and
emitting the uses on the second pass.  But Chris Reade shows how streams
allow the dictionary to be built lazily, so that only a single pass is
needed.  Consider a stream of requests:

<pre class="example">     (define requests
       (stream
         '(get 3)
         '(put 1 "a")    ; use follows definition
         '(put 3 "c")    ; use precedes definition
         '(get 1)
         '(get 2)
         '(put 2 "b")    ; use precedes definition
         '(put 4 "d")))  ; unused definition
</pre>
   <p>We want a procedure that will display cab, which is the result of
<code>(get 3)</code>, <code>(get 1)</code>, and <code>(get 2)</code>, in order.  We first
separate the request stream into gets and puts:

<pre class="example">     (define (get? obj) (eq? (car obj) 'get))
     
     (define-stream (gets strm)
       (stream-map cadr (stream-filter get? strm)))
     
     (define-stream (puts strm)
       (stream-map cdr  (stream-remove get? strm)))
</pre>
   <p>Now, <code>run-dict</code> inserts each element of the puts stream into a lazy
dictionary, represented as a stream of key/value pairs (an association
stream), then looks up each element of the gets stream with
<code>stream-assoc</code>:

<pre class="example">     (define-stream (run-dict requests)
       (let ([dict (build-dict (puts requests))])
         (stream-map (rsec stream-assoc dict)
           (gets requests))))
     
     (define (stream-assoc key dict)
         (cond [(stream-null? dict) #f]
               [(equal? key (car (stream-car dict)))
                (stream-car dict)]
               [else (stream-assoc key
                       (stream-cdr dict))]))
</pre>
   <p><var>dict</var> is created in the <code>let</code>, but nothing is initially added
to it.  Each time <code>stream-assoc</code> performs a lookup, enough of
<var>dict</var> is built to satisfy the lookup, but no more.  We are assuming
that each item is defined once and only once.  All that is left is to
define the procedure that inserts new items into the dictionary, lazily:

<pre class="example">     (define-stream (build-dict puts)
       (if (stream-null? puts)
           stream-null
         (stream-cons
           (stream-car puts)
           (build-dict (stream-cdr puts)))))
     
</pre>
   <p>Now we can run the requests and print the result:

<pre class="example">     (stream-for-each display
       (stream-map cadr (run-dict requests)))
</pre>
   <p>The <code>(put 4 "d")</code> definition is never added to the dictionary
because it is never needed.
