This document describes version 0.3d6 of Vicare Scheme, an
R6RS compliant native compiler for the Scheme language, producing
single threaded programs running on Intel x86 32-bit processors, with
experimental support for 64-bit machines.  _Vicare_ is pronounced
the etruscan way.

<h4 class="subsection">3.1.12 Continuations</h4>

<p>Whenever a Scheme expression is evaluated there is a <dfn>continuation</dfn>
wanting the result of the expression.  The continuation represents an
entire (default) future for the computation.  For example, informally
the continuation of <code>3</code> in the expression

<pre class="example">     (+ 1 3)
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">adds 1 to it.  Normally these ubiquitous continuations are hidden behind
the scenes and programmers do not think much about them.  On rare
occasions, however, a programmer may need to deal with continuations
explicitly.

   <p>The <code>call-with-current-continuation</code> procedure allows Scheme
programmers to do that by creating a procedure that reinstates the
current continuation.  <a href="baselib-control.html#baselib-control">Control features</a>

   <p>The <code>call-with-current-continuation</code> procedure accepts a procedure,
calls it immediately with an argument that is an <em>escape
procedure</em>.  This escape procedure can then be called with an argument
that becomes the result of the call to
<code>call-with-current-continuation</code>.  That is, the escape procedure
abandons its own continuation, and reinstates the continuation of the
call to <code>call-with-current-continuation</code>.

   <p>In the following example, an escape procedure representing the
continuation that adds &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">1</span></samp>&rsquo; to its argument is bound to
<code>escape</code>, and then called with &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">3</span></samp>&rsquo; as an argument.  The
continuation of the call to <code>escape</code> is abandoned, and instead the
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">3</span></samp>&rsquo; is passed to the continuation that adds &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">1</span></samp>&rsquo;:

<pre class="example">     (+ 1 (call-with-current-continuation
            (lambda (escape)
              (+ 2 (escape 3)))))
     &rArr; 4
</pre>
   <p>An escape procedure has unlimited extent: It can be called after the
continuation it captured has been invoked, and it can be called multiple
times.  This makes <code>call-with-current-continuation</code> significantly
more powerful than typical non&ndash;local control constructs such as
exceptions in other languages.
