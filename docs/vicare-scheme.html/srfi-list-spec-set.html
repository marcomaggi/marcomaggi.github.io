<h5 class="subsubsection">14.2.5.11 Set operations on lists</h5>

<p><a name="index-List-set-operations-4159"></a><a name="index-Set-operations-on-lists-4160"></a>

   <p>These procedures implement operations on sets represented as lists of
elements.  They all take an <var>=</var> argument used to compare elements of
lists.  This equality procedure is required to be consistent with
<code>eq?</code>.  That is, it must be the case that:

<pre class="example">     (eq? x y) =&gt; (= x y)
</pre>
   <p>Note that this implies, in turn, that two lists that are <code>eq?</code> are
also set&ndash;equal by any legal comparison procedure.  This allows for
constant&ndash;time determination of set operations on <code>eq?</code> lists.

   <p>Be aware that these procedures typically run in time O(n * m) for n&ndash;
and m&ndash;element list arguments.  Performance&ndash;critical applications
operating upon large sets will probably wish to use other data
structures and algorithms.

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: <b>lset&lt;=</b><var> = list1 ...<a name="index-lset_003c_003d-4161"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>Return true if, and only if, every <var>listi</var> is a subset of
<var>listi+1</var>, using <var>=</var> for the element&ndash;equality procedure.  List
<var>AL</var> is a subset of list <var>BL</var> if every element in <var>AL</var> is
equal to some element of <var>BL</var>.  When performing an element
comparison, the <var>=</var> procedure's first argument is an element of
<var>AL</var>, its second argument an element of <var>BL</var>.

        <p>Examples:

     <pre class="example">          (lset&lt;= eq? '(a) '(a b a) '(a b c c)) =&gt; #t
          
          (lset&lt;= eq?) =&gt; #t             ; Trivial cases
          (lset&lt;= eq? '(a)) =&gt; #t
</pre>
        </blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: <b>lset=</b><var> = list1 list2 ...<a name="index-lset_003d-4162"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>Return true if, and only if, every <var>listi</var> is set&ndash;equal to
<var>listi+1</var>, using <var>=</var> for the element&ndash;equality procedure. 
&ldquo;Set&ndash;equal&rdquo; simply means that <var>listi</var> is a subset of
<var>listi+1</var>, and <var>listi+1</var> is a subset of <var>listi</var>.  The
<var>=</var> procedure's first argument is an element of <var>listi</var>, its
second argument is an element of <var>listi+1</var>.

        <p>Examples:

     <pre class="example">          (lset= eq? '(b e a) '(a e b) '(e e b a)) =&gt; #t
          
          (lset= eq?) =&gt; #t               ; Trivial cases
          (lset= eq? '(a)) =&gt; #t
</pre>
        </blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: <b>lset-adjoin</b><var> = list elt1 ...<a name="index-lset_002dadjoin-4163"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>Add the <var>elti</var> elements not already in the <var>list</var> parameter to
the result list.  The result shares a common tail with the <var>list</var>
parameter.  The new elements are added to the front of the list, but no
guarantees are made about their order.  The <var>=</var> parameter is an
equality procedure used to determine if an elti is already a member of
list.  Its first argument is an element of <var>list</var>, its second is one
of the <var>elti</var>.

        <p>The <var>list</var> parameter is always a suffix of the result; even if the
list parameter contains repeated elements, these are not reduced.

        <p>Example:

     <pre class="example">          (lset-adjoin eq? '(a b c d c e) 'a 'e 'i 'o 'u)
            =&gt; (u o i a b c d c e)

&mdash; Function: <b>lset-union!</b><var> = list1 ...<a name="index-lset_002dunion_0021-4165"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>Return the union of the lists, using <var>=</var> for the element&ndash;equality
procedure.

        <p>The union of lists <var>AL</var> and <var>BL</var> is constructed as follows:

          <ol type=1 start=1>
<li>If <var>AL</var> is the empty list, the answer is <var>BL</var> (or a copy of
<var>BL</var>).

          <li>Otherwise, the result is initialised to be list <var>AL</var> (or a copy of
<var>AL</var>).

          <li>Proceed through the elements of list <var>BL</var> in a left&ndash;to&ndash;right
order.  If <var>b</var> is such an element of <var>BL</var>, compare every element
<var>r</var> of the current result list to <var>b</var>: <code>(= r b)</code>.  If all
comparisons fail, <var>b</var> is consed onto the front of the result.
             </ol>

        <p>However, there is no guarantee that <var>=</var> will be applied to every
pair of arguments from <var>AL</var> and <var>BL</var>.  In particular, if
<var>AL</var> is <code>eq?</code> to <var>BL</var>, the operation may immediately
terminate.

        <p>In the n&ndash;ary case, the two&ndash;argument <code>list-union</code> operation is
simply folded across the argument lists.

        <p>Examples:

     <pre class="example">          (lset-union eq? '(a b c d e) '(a e i o u))
            =&gt; (u o i a b c d e)

          (lset-union eq? '(a a c) '(x a x)) =&gt; (x a a c)
          
          ;; Trivial cases
          (lset-union eq?) =&gt; ()
          (lset-union eq? '(a b c)) =&gt; (a b c)
</pre>
        <p><code>lset-union!</code> is the linear&ndash;update variant of <code>lset-union</code>. 
It is allowed, but not required, to use the cons cells in the first list
parameter to construct its answer.  <code>lset-union!</code> is permitted to
recycle cons cells from any of its list arguments. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: <b>lset-intersection</b><var> = list1 list2 ...<a name="index-lset_002dintersection-4166"></a></var><br>
&mdash; Function: <b>lset-intersection!</b><var> = list1 ...<a name="index-lset_002dintersection_0021-4167"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>Return the intersection of the lists, using <var>=</var> for the
element&ndash;equality procedure.

        <p>The intersection of lists <var>AL</var> and <var>BL</var> is comprised of every
element of <var>AL</var> that is <var>=</var> to some element of <var>BL</var>:
<code>(= a b)</code>, for <var>a</var> in <var>AL</var>, and <var>b</var> in <var>BL</var>.  Note
this implies that an element which appears in <var>BL</var> and multiple
times in list <var>AL</var> will also appear multiple times in the result.

        <p>The order in which elements appear in the result is the same as they
appear in <var>list1</var>; that is, <code>lset-intersection</code> essentially
filters <var>list1</var>, without disarranging element order.  The result may
share a common tail with <var>list1</var>.

        <p>In the n&ndash;ary case, the two&ndash;argument <code>list-intersection</code> operation
is simply folded across the argument lists.  However, the dynamic order
in which the applications of <var>=</var> are made is not specified.  The
procedure may check an element of <var>list1</var> for membership in every
other list before proceeding to consider the next element of
<var>list1</var>, or it may completely intersect <var>list1</var> and <var>list2</var>

<blockquote><p>Return the difference of the lists, using <var>=</var> for the
element&ndash;equality procedure: all the elements of <var>list1</var> that are
not <var>=</var> to any element from one of the other <var>listi</var> parameters.

        <p>The <var>=</var> procedure's first argument is always an element of
<var>list1</var>; its second is an element of one of the other <var>listi</var>. 
Elements that are repeated multiple times in the <var>list1</var> parameter
will occur multiple times in the result.

        <p>The order in which elements appear in the result is the same as they

&mdash; Function: <b>lset-xor!</b><var> = list1 ...<a name="index-lset_002dxor_0021-4171"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>Return the exclusive&ndash;or of the sets, using <var>=</var> for the
element&ndash;equality procedure.  If there are exactly two lists, this is
all the elements that appear in exactly one of the two lists.  The
operation is associative, and thus extends to the n&ndash;ary case, in which
the result is a list of the elements that appear in an odd number of the
lists.  The result may share a common tail with any of the <var>listi</var>
parameters.

        <p>More precisely, for two lists <var>AL</var> and <var>BL</var>, <var>AL</var> xor
<var>BL</var> is a list of:

          <ul>
<li>every element <var>a</var> of <var>AL</var> such that there is no element <var>b</var>
of <var>BL</var> such that <code>(= a b)</code>, and

          <li>every element <var>b</var> of <var>BL</var> such that there is no element <var>a</var>
of <var>AL</var> such that <code>(= b a)</code>. 
</ul>

        <p>However, an implementation is allowed to assume that <var>=</var> is
symmetric; that is, that <code>(= a b) =&gt; (= b a)</code>.

        <p>This means, for example, that if a comparison <code>(= a b)</code> produces
true for some <var>a</var> in <var>AL</var> and <var>b</var> in <var>BL</var>, both <var>a</var>
and <var>b</var> may be removed from inclusion in the result.

        <p>In the n&ndash;ary case, the binary&ndash;xor operation is simply folded across
the lists.

        <p>Examples:

     <pre class="example">          (lset-xor eq? '(a b c d e) '(a e i o u))
