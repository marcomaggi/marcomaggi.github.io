This document describes version 0.3d6 of Vicare Scheme, an
R6RS compliant native compiler for the Scheme language, producing
single threaded programs running on Intel x86 32-bit processors, with
experimental support for 64-bit machines.  _Vicare_ is pronounced
the etruscan way.

<h4 class="subsection">2.4.4 Examples of library usage</h4>

<p>Consider a program using <code>pretty-print</code> procedure to format some
code, and suppose further that pretty printing is just a nice add&ndash;on
(e.g. using <samp><span class="file">write</span></samp> suffices, but pretty&ndash;printing is <em>just
prettier</em>).

   <p>Vicare exports a good pretty&ndash;printing facility in its
<code>(ikarus)</code> library.  However, since <code>pretty-print</code> is not a
standard procedure, a program that uses it would be rendered unportable
to other <acronym>R6RS</acronym> Scheme implementations.

   <p>The programmer can put the <code>.vicare.*</code> extensions to use in this
situation, by writing two versions of a <code>(pretty-printing)</code>
library: one for use by Vicare, and one portable for other
implementations.

<pre class="example">     ;; pretty-printing.vicare.ss --
     ;;
     ;; Can be used only by Vicare Scheme.
     
     (library (pretty-printing)
       (export pretty-print)
       (import (only (ikarus) pretty-print)))
     
     ;;; end of file
</pre>
   <pre class="example">     ;; pretty-printing.sls --
     ;;
     ;; For any other Scheme implementation, portable though
     ;; not very pretty.
     
     (library (pretty-printing)
       (export pretty-print)
       (import (rnrs))
       (define (pretty-print x port)
         (write x port)
         (newline port)))
     
     ;;; end of file
</pre>
