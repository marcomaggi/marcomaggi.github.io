<a name="Introduction"></a>
<h4 class="subsection">3.1.1 Introduction</h4>


<p>Programming languages should be designed not by piling feature on top of
feature, but by removing the weaknesses and restrictions that make
additional features appear necessary.  Scheme demonstrates that a very
small number of rules for forming expressions, with no restrictions on
how they are composed, suffice to form a practical and efficient
programming language that is flexible enough to support most of the
major programming paradigms in use today.
</p>
<p>Scheme was one of the first programming languages to incorporate
first&ndash;class procedures as in the lambda calculus, thereby proving the
usefulness of static scope rules and block structure in a dynamically
typed language.
</p>
<p>Scheme was the first major dialect of Lisp to distinguish procedures
from lambda expressions and symbols, to use a single lexical environment
for all variables, and to evaluate the operator position of a procedure
call in the same way as an operand position.
</p>
<p>By relying entirely on procedure calls to express iteration, Scheme
emphasised the fact that tail&ndash;recursive procedure calls are essentially
gotos that pass arguments.
</p>
<p>Scheme was the first widely used programming language to embrace
first&ndash;class escape procedures, from which all previously known
sequential control structures can be synthesised.
</p>
<p>A subsequent version of Scheme introduced the concept of exact and
inexact number objects, an extension of Common Lisp&rsquo;s generic
arithmetic.
</p>
<p>More recently, Scheme became the first programming language to support
hygienic macros, which permit the syntax of a block&ndash;structured language
to be extended in a consistent and reliable manner.
</p>

<a name="Guiding-principles"></a>
<h4 class="subsubheading">Guiding principles</h4>

<p>To help guide the standardisation effort, the <acronym>R6RS</acronym> editors have
adopted a set of principles, presented below.  Like the Scheme language
defined in Revised^5 Report on the Algorithmic Language Scheme, the
language described in the <acronym>R6RS</acronym> report is intended to:
</p>
<ul>
<li> allow programmers to read each other&rsquo;s code, and allow development of
portable programs that can be executed in any conforming implementation
of Scheme;

</li><li> derive its power from simplicity, a small number of generally useful
core syntactic forms and procedures, and no unnecessary restrictions on
how they are composed;

</li><li> allow programs to define new procedures and new hygienic syntactic
forms;

</li><li> support the representation of program source code as data;

</li><li> make procedure calls powerful enough to express any form of sequential
control, and allow programs to perform non&ndash;local control operations
without the use of global program transformations;

</li><li> allow interesting, purely functional programs to run indefinitely
without terminating or running out of memory on finite&ndash;memory machines;

</li><li> allow educators to use the language to teach programming effectively, at
various levels and with a variety of pedagogical approaches;

</li><li> allow researchers to use the language to explore the design,
implementation, and semantics of programming languages.
</li></ul>

<p>In addition, the <acronym>R6RS</acronym> report is intended to:
</p>
<ul>
<li> allow programmers to create and distribute substantial programs and
libraries, e.g., implementations of Scheme Requests for Implementation,
that run without modification in a variety of Scheme implementations;

</li><li> support procedural, syntactic, and data abstraction more fully by
allowing programs to define hygiene&ndash;bending and hygiene&ndash;breaking
syntactic abstractions and new unique datatypes along with procedures
and hygienic macros in any scope;

</li><li> allow programmers to rely on a level of automatic run&ndash;time type and
bounds checking sufficient to ensure type safety;

</li><li> allow implementations to generate efficient code, without requiring
programmers to use implementation&ndash;specific operators or declarations.
</li></ul>

<p>While it was possible to write portable programs in Scheme as described
in Revised^5 Report on the Algorithmic Language Scheme, and indeed
portable Scheme programs were written prior to the <acronym>R6RS</acronym> report, many
Scheme programs were not, primarily because of the lack of substantial
standardised libraries and the proliferation of implementation&ndash;specific
language additions.
</p>
<p>In general, Scheme should include building blocks that allow a wide
variety of libraries to be written, include commonly used user&ndash;level
features to enhance portability and readability of library and
application code, and exclude features that are less commonly used and
easily implemented in separate libraries.
</p>
<p>The language described in the <acronym>R6RS</acronym> report is intended to also be
backward compatible with programs written in Scheme as described in
Revised^5 Report on the Algorithmic Language Scheme to the extent
possible without compromising the above principles and future viability
of the language.  With respect to future viability, the editors have
operated under the assumption that many more Scheme programs will be
written in the future than exist in the present, so the future programs
are those with which we should be most concerned.
