This document describes version 0.3d2 of Vicare Scheme, an
R6RS compliant native compiler for the Scheme language, producing
single threaded programs running on Intel x86 32-bit processors, with
experimental support for 64-bit machines.  _Vicare_ is pronounced
the etruscan way.

<h5 class="subsubsection">14.8.2.1 Strings are code&ndash;point sequences</h5>

<p>This <acronym>SRFI</acronym> considers strings simply to be a sequence of &ldquo;code
points&rdquo; or character encodings.  Operations such as comparison or
reversal are always done code point by code point.  See the comments
below on super&ndash;<acronym>ASCII</acronym> character types for implications that follow.

   <p>It's entirely possible that a legal string might not be a sensible
&ldquo;text&rdquo; sequence.  For example, consider a string comprised entirely of
zero&ndash;width Unicode accent characters with no preceding base character
to modify; this is a legal string, albeit one that does not make a great
deal of sense when interpreted as a sequence of natural&ndash;language text. 
The routines in this <acronym>SRFI</acronym> do not handle these &ldquo;text&rdquo; concerns;
they restrict themselves to the underlying view of strings as merely a
sequence of &ldquo;code points&rdquo;.

   <p>This <acronym>SRFI</acronym> defines string operations that are locale&ndash;independent and
context&ndash;independent.  While it is certainly important to have a
locale&ndash;sensitive comparison or collation procedure when processing
text, it is also important to have a suite of operations that are
reliably invariant for basic string processing; otherwise, a change of
locale could cause data structures such as hash tables, b&ndash;trees, symbol
tables, directories of filenames, etc. to become corrupted.

   <p>Locale&ndash;sensitive and context&ndash;sensitive text operations, such as
collation, are explicitly deferred to a subsequent, companion &ldquo;text&rdquo;
<acronym>SRFI</acronym>.
