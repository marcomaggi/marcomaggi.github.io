This document describes version 0.3d7 of Vicare Scheme, an
R6RS compliant native compiler for the Scheme language, producing
single threaded programs running on Intel x86 32-bit processors, with
experimental support for 64-bit machines.  _Vicare_ is pronounced
the etruscan way.

<h4 class="subsection">3.5.8 Multiple return values</h4>

<p>A Scheme expression can evaluate to an arbitrary finite number of
values.  These values are passed to the expression's continuation.

   <p>Not all continuations accept any number of values. For example, a
continuation that accepts the argument to a procedure call is guaranteed
to accept exactly one value.  The effect of passing some other number of
values to such a continuation is unspecified.  The
<code>call-with-values</code> procedure makes it possible to create
continuations that accept specified numbers of return values.  If the
number of return values passed to a continuation created by a call to
<code>call-with-values</code> is not accepted by its consumer that was passed
in that call, then an exception is raised.  A more complete description
of the number of values accepted by different continuations and the
consequences of passing an unexpected number of values is given in the
description of the <code>values</code> procedure.

   <p>A number of forms in the base library have sequences of expressions as
subforms that are evaluated sequentially, with the return values of all
but the last expression being discarded.  The continuations discarding
these values accept any number of values.
