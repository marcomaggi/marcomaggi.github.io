R6RS compliant native compiler for the Scheme language, producing
single threaded programs running on Intel x86 32-bit processors, with
experimental support for 64-bit machines.  _Vicare_ is pronounced
the etruscan way.

<h5 class="subsubsection">3.4.3.8 Numbers</h5>

<p>The syntax of external representations for number objects is described
formally by the <var>?number</var> rule in the formal grammar.  Case is not
significant in external representations of number objects.

   <p>A representation of a number object may be written in binary, octal,
decimal, or hexadecimal by the use of a radix prefix.  The radix
prefixes are <code>#b</code> (binary), <code>#o</code> (octal), <code>#d</code> (decimal),
and <code>#x</code> (hexadecimal).  With no radix prefix, a representation of
a number object is assumed to be expressed in decimal.

   <p>A representation of a number object may be specified to be either exact
or inexact by a prefix.  The prefixes are <code>#e</code> for exact, and
<code>#i</code> for inexact.  An exactness prefix may appear before or after
any radix prefix that is used.  If the representation of a number object
has no exactness prefix, the constant is inexact if it contains a
decimal point, an exponent, or a nonempty mantissa width; otherwise it
is exact.

   <p>In systems with inexact number objects of varying precisions, it may be
useful to specify the precision of a constant.  For this purpose,
representations of number objects may be written with an exponent marker
that indicates the desired precision of the inexact representation.  The
letters <code>s</code>, <code>f</code>, <code>d</code>, and <code>l</code> specify the use of
<em>short</em>, <em>single</em>, <em>double</em>, and <em>long</em> precision,
respectively.  (When fewer than four internal inexact representations
exist, the four size specifications are mapped onto those available. 
For example, an implementation with two internal representations may map
short and single together and long and double together.)  In addition,
the exponent marker <code>e</code> specifies the default precision for the
implementation.  The default precision has at least as much precision as
<em>double</em>, but implementations may wish to allow this default to be
set by the user.

<pre class="example">     3.1415926535898F0
            Round to single, perhaps 3.141593
     0.6L0
            Extend to long, perhaps .600000000000000
</pre>
   <p>A representation of a number object with nonempty mantissa width,
<code>x|p</code>, represents the best binary floating&ndash;point approximation of
<em>x</em> using a <em>p</em>&ndash;bit significand.  For example, <code>1.1|53</code>
is a representation of the best approximation of 1.1 in <acronym>IEEE</acronym> double
precision.  If <em>x</em> is an external representation of an inexact real
number object that contains no vertical bar, then its numerical value
should be computed as though it had a mantissa width of 53 or more.

   <p>Implementations that use binary floating&ndash;point representations of real
number objects should represent <code>x|p</code> using a <em>p</em>&ndash;bit
significand if practical, or by a greater precision if a <em>p</em>&ndash;bit
significand is not practical, or by the largest available precision if
<em>p</em> or more bits of significand are not practical within the
implementation.

   <blockquote>
<em>Note</em> The precision of a significand should not be confused with
the number of bits used to represent the significand.  In the <acronym>IEEE</acronym>
floating&ndash;point standards, for example, the significand's most
significant bit is implicit in single and double precision but is
explicit in extended precision.  Whether that bit is implicit or
explicit does not affect the mathematical precision.  In implementations
that use binary floating point, the default precision can be calculated
by calling the following procedure:

<pre class="example">     (define (precision)
       (do ([n 0 (+ n 1)]
            [x 1.0 (/ x 2.0)])
         ((= 1.0 (+ 1.0 x)) n)))
</pre>
   </blockquote>

   <blockquote>
<em>Note</em> When the underlying floating&ndash;point representation is
<acronym>IEEE</acronym> double precision, the <code>|p</code> suffix should not always be
omitted: Denormalized floating&ndash;point numbers have diminished precision,
and therefore their external representations should carry a <code>|p</code>
suffix with the actual width of the significand. 
</blockquote>

   <p>The literals <code>+inf.0</code> and <code>-inf.0</code> represent positive and
negative infinity, respectively.  The <code>+nan.0</code> literal represents
the NaN that is the result of <code>(/ 0.0 0.0)</code>, and may represent
other NaNs as well.  The <code>-nan.0</code> literal also represents a NaN.

   <p>If <em>x</em> is an external representation of an inexact real number
object and contains no vertical bar and no exponent marker other than
<code>e</code>, the inexact real number object it represents is a flonum (see
library section &ldquo;Flonums&rdquo;).  Some or all of the other external
representations of inexact real number objects may also represent
flonums, but that is not required by this report.
