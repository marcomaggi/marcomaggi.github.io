This document describes version 0.3d4 of Vicare Scheme, an
R6RS compliant native compiler for the Scheme language, producing
single threaded programs running on Intel x86 32-bit processors, with
experimental support for 64-bit machines.  _Vicare_ is pronounced
the etruscan way.

<h4 class="subsection">14.27.2 Rationale</h4>

<p>The Scheme community needs a standard for writing test suites.  Every
<acronym>SRFI</acronym> or other library should come with a test suite.  Such a test
suite must be portable, without requiring any non&ndash;standard features,
such as modules.  The test suite implementation or <dfn>runner</dfn> need not
be portable, but it is desirable that it be possible to write a portable
basic implementation.

   <p>There are other testing frameworks written in Scheme, including
SchemeUnit.  However SchemeUnit is not portable.  It is also a bit on
the verbose side.  It would be useful to have a bridge between this
framework and SchemeUnit so SchemeUnit tests could run under this
framework and vice versa.  There exists also at least one Scheme wrapper
providing a Scheme interface to the &ldquo;standard&rdquo; JUnit <acronym>API</acronym> for Java. 
It would be useful to have a bridge so that tests written using this
framework can run under a JUnit runner.  Neither of these features are
part of this specification.

   <p>This <acronym>API</acronym> makes use of implicit dynamic state, including an implicit
&ldquo;test runner&rdquo;.  This makes the <acronym>API</acronym> convenient and terse to use, but
it may be a little less elegant and &ldquo;compositional&rdquo; than using
explicit test objects, such as JUnit&ndash;style frameworks.  It is not
claimed to follow either object&ndash;oriented or functional design
principles, but I hope it is useful and convenient to use and extend.

   <p>This proposal allows converting a Scheme source file to a test suite by
just adding a few macros.  You don't have to write the entire file in a
new form, thus you don't have to reindent it.

   <p>All names defined by the <acronym>API</acronym> start with the prefix <code>test-</code>.  All
function&ndash;like forms are defined as syntax.  They may be implemented as
functions or macros or builtins.  The reason for specifying them as
syntax is to allow specific tests to be skipped without evaluating
subexpressions, or for implementations to add features such as printing
line numbers or catching exceptions.
