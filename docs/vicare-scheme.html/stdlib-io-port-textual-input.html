R6RS compliant native compiler for the Scheme language, producing
single threaded programs running on Intel x86 32-bit processors, with
experimental support for 64-bit machines.  _Vicare_ is pronounced
the etruscan way.

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Procedure: <b>get-char</b><var> textual-input-port<a name="index-get_002dchar-706"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>Read from <var>textual-input-port</var>, blocking as necessary, until a
complete character is available, or until an end of file is reached.

        <p>If a complete character is available before the next end of file,
<code>get-char</code> returns that character and updates the input port to
point past the character.  If an end of file is reached before any
character is read, <code>get-char</code> returns the end&ndash;of&ndash;file object. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Procedure: <b>lookahead-char</b><var> textual-input-port<a name="index-lookahead_002dchar-707"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>The <code>lookahead-char</code> procedure is like <code>get-char</code>, but it does
not update <var>textual-input-port</var> to point past the character.

        <blockquote>
<strong>NOTE</strong> With some of the standard transcoders described in this
document, up to four bytes of lookahead are needed.  Non&ndash;standard
transcoders may need even more lookahead. 
</blockquote>
        </p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Procedure: <b>get-string-n</b><var> textual-input-port count<a name="index-get_002dstring_002dn-708"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p><var>count</var> must be an exact, non&ndash;negative integer object, representing
the number of characters to be read.

        <p>The <code>get-string-n</code> procedure reads from <var>textual-input-port</var>,
blocking as necessary, until <var>count</var> characters are available, or
until an end of file is reached.

        <p>If <var>count</var> characters are available before end of file,
<code>get-string-n</code> returns a string consisting of those <var>count</var>
characters.

        <p>If fewer characters are available before an end of file, but one or more
characters can be read, <code>get-string-n</code> returns a string containing
those characters.

        <p>In either case, the input port is updated to point just past the
characters read.  If no characters can be read before an end of file,
the end-of-file object is returned. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Procedure: <b>get-string-n!</b><var> textual-input-port string start count<a name="index-get_002dstring_002dn_0021-709"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p><var>start</var> and <var>count</var> must be exact, non&ndash;negative integer
objects, with <var>count</var> representing the number of characters to be
read.  <var>string</var> must be a string with at least
<var>start</var>+<var>count</var> characters.

        <p>The <code>get-string-n!</code> procedure reads from <var>textual-input-port</var>
in the same manner as <code>get-string-n</code>.

        <p>If <var>count</var> characters are available before an end of file, they are
written into <var>string</var> starting at index <var>start</var>, and <var>count</var>
is returned.

        <p>If fewer characters are available before an end of file, but one or more
can be read, those characters are written into <var>string</var> starting at
index <var>start</var> and the number of characters actually read is returned
as an exact integer object.

        <p>If no characters can be read before an end of file, the end&ndash;of&ndash;file
object is returned. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Procedure: <b>get-string-all</b><var> textual-input-port<a name="index-get_002dstring_002dall-710"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>Read from <var>textual-input-port</var> until an end of file, decoding
characters in the same manner as <code>get-string-n</code> and
<code>get-string-n!</code>.

        <p>If characters are available before the end of file, a string containing
all the characters decoded from that data is returned.  If no character
precedes the end of file, the end&ndash;of&ndash;file object is returned. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Procedure: <b>get-line</b><var> textual-input-port<a name="index-get_002dline-711"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>Read from <var>textual-input-port</var> up to and including the linefeed
character or end of file, decoding characters in the same manner as
<code>get-string-n</code> and <code>get-string-n!</code>.

        <p>If a linefeed character is read, a string containing all of the text up
to (but not including) the linefeed character is returned, and the port
is updated to point just past the linefeed character.

        <p>If an end of file is encountered before any linefeed character is read,
but some characters have been read and decoded as characters, a string
containing those characters is returned.

        <p>If an end of file is encountered before any characters are read, the
end&ndash;of&ndash;file object is returned.

        <blockquote>
<strong>NOTE</strong> The end&ndash;of&ndash;line style, if not <code>none</code>, will cause all
line endings to be read as linefeed characters. 
</blockquote>
        </p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Procedure: <b>get-datum</b><var> textual-input-port<a name="index-get_002ddatum-712"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>Read an external representation from <var>textual-input-port</var> and return
the datum it represents.  The <code>get-datum</code> procedure returns the
next datum that can be parsed from the given <var>textual-input-port</var>,
updating <var>textual-input-port</var> to point exactly past the end of the
external representation of the object.

        <p>Any <var>?interlexeme-space</var> (<a href="scheme-lex-syntax.html#scheme-lex-syntax">scheme lex syntax</a>) in the input is
first skipped.  If an end of file occurs after the
<var>?interlexeme-space</var>, the end&ndash;of&ndash;file object is returned.

        <p>If a character inconsistent with an external representation is
encountered in the input, an exception with condition types
<code>&amp;lexical</code> and <code>&amp;i/o-read</code> is raised.

        <p>Also, if the end of file is encountered after the beginning of an
external representation, but the external representation is incomplete
and therefore cannot be parsed, an exception with condition types
<code>&amp;lexical</code> and <code>&amp;i/o-read</code> is raised.
