This document describes version 0.3d6 of Vicare Scheme, an
R6RS compliant native compiler for the Scheme language, producing
single threaded programs running on Intel x86 32-bit processors, with
experimental support for 64-bit machines.  _Vicare_ is pronounced
the etruscan way.

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Procedure: <b>get-u8</b><var> binary-input-port<a name="index-get_002du8-700"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>Read from <var>binary-input-port</var>, blocking as necessary, until a byte
is available from <var>binary-input-port</var> or until an end of file is
reached.  If a byte becomes available, <code>get-u8</code> returns the byte as
an octet and updates <var>binary-input-port</var> to point just past that
byte.  If no input byte is seen before an end of file is reached, the
end&ndash;of&ndash;file object is returned. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Procedure: <b>lookahead-u8</b><var> binary-input-port<a name="index-lookahead_002du8-701"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>The <code>lookahead-u8</code> procedure is like <code>get-u8</code>, but it does not
update <var>binary-input-port</var> to point past the byte.

&mdash; Procedure: <b>get-bytevector-n</b><var> binary-input-port count<a name="index-get_002dbytevector_002dn-702"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p><var>count</var> must be an exact, non&ndash;negative integer object representing
the number of bytes to be read.

        <p>The <code>get-bytevector-n</code> procedure reads from
<var>binary-input-port</var>, blocking as necessary, until <var>count</var> bytes
are available from <var>binary-input-port</var> or until an end of file is
reached.

        <p>If <var>count</var> bytes are available before an end of file,
<code>get-bytevector-n</code> returns a bytevector of size <var>count</var>.

        <p>If fewer bytes are available before an end of file,
<code>get-bytevector-n</code> returns a bytevector containing those bytes. In
either case, the input port is updated to point just past the bytes
read.

        <p>If an end of file is reached before any bytes are available,
<code>get-bytevector-n</code> returns the end&ndash;of&ndash;file object. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Procedure: <b>get-bytevector-n!</b><var> binary-input-port bytevector start count<a name="index-get_002dbytevector_002dn_0021-703"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p><var>count</var> must be an exact, non&ndash;negative integer object, representing
the number of bytes to be read. <var>bytevector</var> must be a bytevector
with at least <var>start</var>+<var>count</var> elements.

        <p>The <code>get-bytevector-n!</code> procedure reads from
<var>binary-input-port</var>, blocking as necessary, until <var>count</var> bytes
are available from <var>binary-input-port</var> or until an end of file is
reached.

        <p>If <var>count</var> bytes are available before an end of file, they are
written into <var>bytevector</var> starting at index <var>start</var>, and the
result is <var>count</var>.

        <p>If fewer bytes are available before the next end of file, the available
bytes are written into <var>bytevector</var> starting at index <var>start</var>,
and the result is a number object representing the number of bytes
actually read.

        <p>In either case, the input port is updated to point just past the bytes
read.  If an end of file is reached before any bytes are available,
<code>get-bytevector-n!</code> returns the end&ndash;of&ndash;file object.

<div class="defun">

<blockquote><p>Read from <var>binary-input-port</var>, blocking as necessary, until bytes
are available from <var>binary-input-port</var> or until an end of file is
reached.  If bytes become available, <code>get-bytevector-some</code> returns
a freshly allocated bytevector containing the initial available bytes
(at least one), and it updates <var>binary-input-port</var> to point just
past these bytes.  If no input bytes are seen before an end of file is
reached, the end&ndash;of&ndash;file object is returned.

<div class="defun">

<blockquote><p>Attempts to read all bytes until the next end of file, blocking as
necessary.  If one or more bytes are read, <code>get-bytevector-all</code>
returns a bytevector containing all bytes up to the next end of file. 
Otherwise, <code>get-bytevector-all</code> returns the end&ndash;of&ndash;file object. 
The operation may block indefinitely waiting to see if more bytes will
become available, even if some bytes are already available.
