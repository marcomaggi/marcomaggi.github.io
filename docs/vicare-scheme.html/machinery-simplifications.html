<h3 class="section">16.1 Simplification assumptions</h3>


<p>To make it easy to explain the run time behaviour of Vicare, we
will assume the validity of the following simplifications:
</p>
<ol>
<li> At the start of a user program execution: the Scheme stack is empty.
This is false because, at Vicare launch time, the boot image is
loaded and initialised, executing a lot of compiled Scheme code.  But
starting with an empty stack makes reasoning simpler.

</li><li> No expressions and function calls are inlined.  This is false because
the compiler precomputes some expressions, inlines some function calls
and removes bindings whenever possible; this makes the executed code
different from the original Scheme code.  But we want to show sample
Scheme code as close as possible to the one that gets executed.

</li><li> Unless otherwise specified: no tail call optimisation (<acronym>TCO</acronym>) is
performed.  This is false because, whenever it recognises a function
call in tail position, Vicare always performs the call in such
a way that the new stack frame overwrites the old one.  But we want to
show simple functions that create new stack frames.

</li><li> The function <code>call/cc</code> is implemented without subordinate function
calls.  This is depends upon the function call integration optimisations
performed by the compiler.  But reasoning about simple function call is
simpler.

</li><li> There is no dynamic environment to be captured by continuations.  This
is false because whenever <code>dynamic-wind</code> is used stacks of
in&ndash;guard and out&ndash;guard functions are created and captured by
continuations; the continuation escape function, created by
<code>call/cc</code>, does invoke such guard functions to keep the dynamic
environment synchronised with the execution flow.  But learning about
continuations alone already introduces enough complications.

</li><li> When discussing sample programs we assume that only the code we see is
executed.  This is false because whenever a user program is run: the
code is loaded and compiled, then some initialisation is performed
before running it.  Rather when dissussing the execution of:

<div class="example">
<pre class="example">(import (rnrs))
(define (one a)
  (+ a 1))
(one 2)
</pre></div>

<p>we assume that the first executed code is the expression <code>(one 2)</code>.
</p></li></ol>
