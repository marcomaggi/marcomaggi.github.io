This document describes version 0.3d4 of Vicare Scheme, an
R6RS compliant native compiler for the Scheme language, producing
single threaded programs running on Intel x86 32-bit processors, with
experimental support for 64-bit machines.  _Vicare_ is pronounced
the etruscan way.

<h3 class="section">32.1 Simplification assumptions</h3>

<p>To make it easy to explain the run time behaviour of Vicare, we
will assume the validity of the following simplifications:

     <ol type=1 start=1>
<li>At the start of a user program execution: the Scheme stack is empty. 
This is false because, at Vicare launch time, the boot image is
loaded and initialised, executing a lot of compiled Scheme code.  But
starting with an empty stack makes reasoning simpler.

     <li>No expressions and function calls are inlined.  This is false because
the compiler precomputes some expressions, inlines some function calls
and removes bindings whenever possible; this makes the executed code
different from the original Scheme code.  But we want to show sample
Scheme code as close as possible to the one that gets executed.

     <li>Unless otherwise specified: no tail call optimisation (<acronym>TCO</acronym>) is
performed.  This is false because, whenever it recognises a function
call in tail position, Vicare always performs the call in such
a way that the new stack frame overwrites the old one.  But we want to
show simple functions that create new stack frames.

     <li>The function <code>call/cc</code> is implemented without subordinate function
calls.  This is depends upon the function call integration optimisations
performed by the compiler.  But reasoning about simple function call is
simpler.

     <li>There is no dynamic environment to be captured by continuations.  This
is false because whenever <code>dynamic-wind</code> is used stacks of
in&ndash;guard and out&ndash;guard functions are created and captured by
continuations; the continuation escape function, created by
<code>call/cc</code>, does invoke such guard functions to keep the dynamic
environment synchronised with the execution flow.  But learning about
continuations alone already introduces enough complications.

     <li>When discussing sample programs we assume that only the code we see is
executed.  This is false because whenever a user program is run: the
code is loaded and compiled, then some initialisation is performed
before running it.  Rather when dissussing the execution of:

     <pre class="example">          (import (rnrs))
          (define (one a)
            (+ a 1))
          (one 2)
</pre>
     <p class="noindent">we assume that the first executed code is the expression <code>(one 2)</code>.
        </ol>
