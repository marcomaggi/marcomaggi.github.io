<h3 class="section">17.1 Introduction</h3>

<p>Scheme does not properly have a list type, just as the C language does
not have a string type.  Rather, Scheme has a binary&ndash;tuple type, from
which one can build binary trees.  There is an interpretation of Scheme
values that allows one to treat these trees as lists.  Further
complications ensue from the fact that Scheme allows side&ndash;effects to
these tuples, raising the possibility of lists of unbounded length, and
trees of unbounded depth (that is, circular data structures).

   <p>What follows is a classification of concrete values with respect to
<dfn>list</dfn> as an abstract concept.

<!--  -->
<h5 class="subsubheading">Null value</h5>

<p>It is a special value which can be identified with the predicate
<code>null?</code>.  Null is meant to represent empty lists and to be the
terminator for proper lists.

   <p><code>length</code> applied to null returns zero.  In light of what follows,
it makes sense to consider null as a list of length zero for all the
list classes: proper, circular, dotted, generalised.

<!--  -->
<h5 class="subsubheading">Proper lists</h5>

<p>A finite, null&ndash;terminated list; more precisely a proper list is defined
as: A pair whose cdr is a proper list or null.  The opposite of proper
is <dfn>improper</dfn>; everything that is not null or a proper list, is an
improper list.

<pre class="example">     (a b c)
     (32)
</pre>
   <p>We can build a proper list in a single function call with <code>list</code>,
or we can do it in steps using <code>cons</code> and <code>cons*</code>; we can
detect if a list is proper with <code>list?</code>.

<!--  -->
<h5 class="subsubheading">Circular list</h5>

<p>An infinite, unterminated list; a circular list is a value such that
<code>cdr</code> applied any number of times always returns a pair.  The
opposite of circular is <dfn>finite</dfn>.

   <p>We can build a list having a circular tail as follows:

<pre class="example">     (define end  (cons  1 '()))
     (define tail (cons* 3 2 end))
     (define ell  (cons* 5 4 tail))
     (set-cdr! end tail)
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">the list structure bound to &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">ell</span></samp>&rsquo; looks like this:

<pre class="example">                                cdr
                       ----------------
                      |                |
          cdr    cdr  v cdr    cdr     |
        O-----&gt;O-----&gt;O-----&gt;O-----&gt;O--
        |      |      |      |      |
     car|   car|   car|   car|   car|
        v      v      v      v      v
        5      4      3      2      1
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">so that the following happens:

<pre class="example">     (car ell)            &rArr; 5
     (cadr ell)           &rArr; 4
     (caddr ell)          &rArr; 3
     (cadddr ell)         &rArr; 2
     (cadddr (cdr ell))   &rArr; 1
     (cdddr (cddr ell))   &rArr; tail
     (cadddr (cddr ell))  &rArr; 3
     (cadddr (cdddr ell)) &rArr; 2
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">it is impossible to build a circular list without mutating a pair. 
Notice that the following is <strong>not</strong> a circular list:

<pre class="example">                                car
                --------------------
               |                    |
          cdr  v cdr    cdr    cdr  | cdr
        O-----&gt;O-----&gt;O-----&gt;O-----&gt;O-----&gt;()
        |      |      |      |
     car|   car|   car|   car|
        v      v      v      v
        5      4      3      2
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">it is a proper list in which the car of the last pair references one of
the previous pairs.

   <p>We can build a circular list, a ring, with <code>circular-list</code> and we
can detect if a list is a ring or has a circular tail with
<code>circular-list?</code>.

<!--  -->
<h5 class="subsubheading">Dotted list</h5>

<p>A finite, non&ndash;nil terminated list, such as:

<pre class="example">     (a b c . d)
     (x . y)
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">a dotted list is a value for which there exists an integer n &gt; 0,
such that <code>cdr</code> applied n times yields neither a pair nor
null.  This means that, for a dotted list, either <code>null?</code> or
<code>pair?</code> return <code>#t</code>.

   <p>Users of the <code>(vicare containers lists ---)</code> libraries should note
that dotted lists are not commonly used, and are considered by many
Scheme programmers to be an ugly artifact of Scheme's lack of a true
list type.  However, dotted lists do play a noticeable role in the
syntax of Scheme, in the &ldquo;rest&rdquo; parameters used by n&ndash;ary lambdas:

<pre class="example">     (lambda (x y . rest)
       ---)
</pre>
   <p>Dotted lists are not fully supported by the list libraries; most
procedures are defined only on proper lists.  The procedures that will
also handle circular or dotted lists are specifically marked.  While
this design decision restricts the domain of possible arguments one can
pass to these procedures, it has the benefit of allowing the procedures
to catch the error cases where programmers inadvertently pass scalar
values to a list procedure by accident (for example, by switching the
arguments to a procedure call).

<!--  -->
<h5 class="subsubheading">Improper list</h5>

<p>A finite, non&ndash;nil terminated list, such as:

<pre class="example">     (a b c . d)
     (x . y)
     42
     george
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">a improper list is a value for which there exists an integer n &gt;=
0, such that <code>cdr</code> applied n times yields neither a pair
nor null.  This includes non&ndash;pair, non&ndash;null values (symbols, numbers,
etc.), which are considered to be improper lists of length 0. 
Dotted lists are improper lists.
