This document describes version 0.3d4 of Vicare Scheme, an
R6RS compliant native compiler for the Scheme language, producing
single threaded programs running on Intel x86 32-bit processors, with
experimental support for 64-bit machines.  _Vicare_ is pronounced
the etruscan way.

<h4 class="subsection">21.2.1 Introduction</h4>

<h5 class="subsubheading">Library organisation</h5>

<p>The functions are split in a high level library, <code>(vicare
containers bytevectors s8)</code> and <code>(vicare containers bytevectors
u8)</code>, and a low level one, <code>(vicare containers bytevectors s8low)</code>
and <code>(vicare containers bytevectors u8low)</code>.  The main difference
between the two layers is that the high level library makes heavy usage
of macros to implement the <dfn>bytevector views</dfn>, which allow accessing
subvectors using a friendly syntax.

   <p>All the functions in the low level library are bound to identifiers
starting with <code>%</code>; for example: <code>bytevector-u8-prefix?</code> is a
high level macro, <code>%bytevector-u8-prefix?</code> is its low level
function homologous.

<h5 class="subsubheading">Direction of iteration</h5>

<p>The library accesses the bytes of a vector in left&ndash;to&ndash;right or
right&ndash;to&ndash;left order depending on the convenience of the algorithm.

<h5 class="subsubheading">Handling side effects</h5>

<p>Care must be taken when using functions with side effects.  One reason
for this is that some of the supported Scheme implementations may
collapse equal datum bytevectors in the source code to the same
bytevector in the program.  Mutating such a bytevector in a point of the
program, will make the change visible to other points in the program.
