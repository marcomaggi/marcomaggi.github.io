This document describes version 0.3d4 of Vicare Scheme, an
R6RS compliant native compiler for the Scheme language, producing
single threaded programs running on Intel x86 32-bit processors, with
experimental support for 64-bit machines.  _Vicare_ is pronounced
the etruscan way.

<h4 class="subsection">26.2.2 Multiply with carry</h4>

<p>Multiply&ndash;with&ndash;carry (<acronym>MWC</acronym>) is a method invented by George
Marsaglia for generating sequences of pseudo&ndash;random integers based on
an initial set of from two to many thousands of randomly chosen seed
values<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-1" name="fnd-1"><sup>1</sup></a>.

   <p>The main advantage of the <acronym>MWC</acronym> method is that it invokes simple
computer integer arithmetic and leads to very fast generation of
sequences of pseudo&ndash;random numbers with immense periods, ranging from
around 260 to 22e6.  As with most <acronym>PRNG</acronym>s, the
resulting sequences are functions of the randomly chosen seed values,
but <acronym>MWC</acronym> generators seem to behave as well as, and often better
than, others in tests of randomness.

   <p>A <acronym>MWC</acronym> sequence is based on arithmetic modulo M, usually
2^32, because arithmetic modulo that M is automatic in
most computers, but sometimes a modulo such as 32^2 - 1 is used,
because arithmetic for modulus 2^32 - 1 requires only a simple
adjustment from that for 2^32, and theory for <acronym>MWC</acronym>
sequences based on modulus 2^32 has some nagging difficulties
that use of 2^32 - 1 avoids.

   <p>Complementary&ndash;multiply&ndash;with&ndash;carry generators (<acronym>CMWC</acronym>) are a
slightly modified form of <acronym>MWC</acronym> giving better results.  A basic
formulation of the algorithm uses the recurrence:

<pre class="example">     N' = (M - 1) - (a * N + C) mod M    0 &lt;= N &lt; M
     
                a * N + C
     C' = floor ---------                     C &lt; a
                    M
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">to generate a new number N' and a new carry C' from an
initial state N and an initial carry C, a being the
recursion coefficient and M being the modulo.

   <p>Better formulations adopt a &ldquo;lag&rdquo; of r values: Chosen a
positive integer r, an initial carry C and a vector
[N(1), N(2), ..., N(r)] of initial seed values, the new number
N' and the new carry C' are computed using the seed
N(r) as:

<pre class="example">     N' = (M - 1) - (a * N(r) + C) mod M
     
                a * N(r) + C
     C' = floor ------------
                     M
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">then the seed vector is right&ndash;shifted purging N(r):

<pre class="example">     N(r)   = N(r-1)
     N(r-1) = N(r-2)
     ...
     N(2)   = N(1)
     N(1)   = N'
</pre>
