<h4 class="subsection">3.5.6 Safety</h4>


<p>The standard libraries whose exports are described by this document are
said to be <em>safe libraries</em>.  Libraries and top&ndash;level programs
that import only from safe libraries are also said to be safe.
</p>
<p>As defined by this document, the Scheme programming language is safe in
the following sense: The execution of a safe top&ndash;level program cannot
go so badly wrong as to crash or to continue to execute while behaving
in ways that are inconsistent with the semantics described in this
document, unless an exception is raised.
</p>
<p>Violations of an implementation restriction must raise an exception with
condition type <code>&amp;implementation-restriction</code>, as must all
violations and errors that would otherwise threaten system integrity in
ways that might result in execution that is inconsistent with the
semantics described in this document.
</p>
<p>The above safety properties are guaranteed only for top&ndash;level programs
and libraries that are said to be safe.  In particular, implementations
may provide access to unsafe libraries in ways that cannot guarantee
safety.
</p>
