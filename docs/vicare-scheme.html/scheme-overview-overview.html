<h4 class="subsection">3.1.2 Overview</h4>


<p>This chapter gives an overview of Scheme&rsquo;s semantics.  The purpose of
this overview is to explain enough about the basic concepts of the
language to facilitate understanding of the subsequent chapters of the
report, which are organized as a reference manual.  Consequently, this
overview is neither a complete introduction to the language, nor precise
in all respects, nor normative in any way.
</p>
<p>Following Algol, Scheme is a statically scoped programming language.
Each use of a variable is associated with a lexically apparent binding
of that variable.
</p>
<p>Scheme has <em>latent</em> as opposed to <em>manifest</em> types.  Types are
associated with objects (also called values) rather than with variables.
(Some authors refer to languages with latent types as untyped, weakly
typed or dynamically typed languages.)  Other languages with latent
types are Python, Ruby, Smalltalk, and other dialects of Lisp.
Languages with manifest types (sometimes referred to as strongly typed
or statically typed languages) include Algol 60, C, C#, Java, Haskell,
and ML.
</p>
<p>All objects created in the course of a Scheme computation, including
procedures and continuations, have unlimited extent.  No Scheme object
is ever destroyed.  The reason that implementations of Scheme do not
(usually!) run out of storage is that they are permitted to reclaim the
storage occupied by an object if they can prove that the object cannot
possibly matter to any future computation.  Other languages in which
most objects have unlimited extent include C#, Java, Haskell, most Lisp
dialects, ML, Python, Ruby, and Smalltalk.
</p>
<p>Implementations of Scheme must be properly tail&ndash;recursive.  This allows
the execution of an iterative computation in constant space, even if the
iterative computation is described by a syntactically recursive
procedure.  Thus with a properly tail&ndash;recursive implementation,
iteration can be expressed using the ordinary procedure&ndash;call mechanics,
so that special iteration constructs are useful only as syntactic sugar.
</p>
<p>Scheme was one of the first languages to support procedures as objects
in their own right.  Procedures can be created dynamically, stored in
data structures, returned as results of procedures, and so on.  Other
languages with these properties include Common Lisp, Haskell, ML, Ruby,
and Smalltalk.
</p>
<p>One distinguishing feature of Scheme is that continuations, which in
most other languages only operate behind the scenes, also have
&ldquo;first&ndash;class&rdquo; status.  First&ndash;class continuations are useful for
implementing a wide variety of advanced control constructs, including
non&ndash;local exits, backtracking, and coroutines.
</p>
<p>In Scheme, the argument expressions of a procedure call are evaluated
before the procedure gains control, whether the procedure needs the
result of the evaluation or not.  C, C#, Common Lisp, Python, Ruby, and
Smalltalk are other languages that always evaluate argument expressions
before invoking a procedure.  This is distinct from the lazy&ndash;evaluation
semantics of Haskell, or the call&ndash;by&ndash;name semantics of Algol 60, where
an argument expression is not evaluated unless its value is needed by
the procedure.
</p>
<p>Scheme&rsquo;s model of arithmetic provides a rich set of numerical types and
operations on them.  Furthermore, it distinguishes <em>exact</em> and
<em>inexact</em> number objects: Essentially, an exact number object
corresponds to a number exactly, and an inexact number object is the
result of a computation that involved rounding or other errors.
