This document describes version 0.3d2 of Vicare Scheme, an
R6RS compliant native compiler for the Scheme language, producing
single threaded programs running on Intel x86 32-bit processors, with
experimental support for 64-bit machines.  _Vicare_ is pronounced
the etruscan way.

<h4 class="subsection">14.16.2 Abstract</h4>

<p>This document specifies an interface to sources of random bits, or
&ldquo;random sources&rdquo; for brevity.  In particular, there are three
different ways to use the interface, with varying demands on the quality
of the source and the amout of control over the production process:

     <ul>
<li>The &ldquo;no fuss&rdquo; interface specifies that <code>(random-integer n)</code>
produces the next random integer in <code>{0, ..., n-1}</code> and
<code>(random-real)</code> produces the next random real number between zero
and one.  The details of how these random values are produced may not be
very relevant, as long as they appear to be sufficiently random.

     <li>For simulation purposes, on the contrary, it is usually necessary to
know that the numbers are produced deterministically by a pseudo random
number generator of high quality and to have explicit access to its
state.  In addition, one might want to use several independent sources
of random numbers at the same time and it can be useful to have some
simple form of randomization.

     <li>For security applications a serious form of true randomization is
essential, in the sense that it is difficult for an adversary to exploit
or introduce imperfections into the distribution of random bits. 
Moreover, the linear complexity of the stream of random bits is more
important than its statistical properties.  In these applications, an
entropy source (producing truly random bits at a low rate) is used to
randomize a pseudo random number generator to increase the rate of
available bits. 
</ul>

   <p>Once random sources provide the infrastructure to obtain random bits,
these can be used to construct other random deviates.  Most important
are floating point numbers of various distributions and random discrete
structures, such as permutations or graphs.  As there is an essentially
unlimited number of such objects (with limited use elsewhere), we do not
include them in this <acronym>SRFI</acronym>.  In other words, this <acronym>SRFI</acronym> is not
about making all sorts of random objects; it is about obtaining random
bits in a portable, flexible, reliable, and efficient way.
