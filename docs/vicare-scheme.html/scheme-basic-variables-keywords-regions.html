This document describes version 0.3d4 of Vicare Scheme, an
R6RS compliant native compiler for the Scheme language, producing
single threaded programs running on Intel x86 32-bit processors, with
experimental support for 64-bit machines.  _Vicare_ is pronounced
the etruscan way.

   <p>Within the body of a library or top&ndash;level program, an identifier may
name a kind of syntax, or it may name a location where a value can be
stored.  An identifier that names a kind of syntax is called a
<dfn>keyword</dfn>, and is said to be <dfn>bound</dfn> to that kind of syntax (or,
in the case of a syntactic abstraction, a <dfn>transformer</dfn> that
translates the syntax into more primitive forms).  An identifier that
names a location is called a <dfn>variable</dfn> and is said to be
<dfn>bound</dfn> to that location.  At each point within a top&ndash;level program
or a library, a specific, fixed set of identifiers is bound; the set of
these identifiers, the set of <em>visible bindings</em>, is known as the
<dfn>environment</dfn> in effect at that point.

   <p>Certain forms are used to create syntactic abstractions and to bind
keywords to transformers for those new syntactic abstractions, while
other forms create new locations and bind variables to those locations;
collectively, these forms are called <dfn>binding constructs</dfn>.  Some
binding constructs take the form of <em>definitions</em>, while others are
<em>expressions</em>.  With the exception of exported library bindings, a
binding created by a definition is visible only within the body in which
the definition appears, e.g. the body of a library, top&ndash;level program,
or <code>lambda</code> expression.  Exported library bindings are also visible
within the bodies of the libraries and top&ndash;level programs that import
them.

   <p>Expressions that bind variables include the <code>lambda</code>, <code>let</code>,
<code>let*</code>, <code>letrec</code>, <code>letrec*</code>, <code>let-values</code>, and
<code>let*-values</code> forms from the base library.  Of these, <code>lambda</code>
is the most fundamental.  Variable definitions appearing within the body
of such an expression, or within the bodies of a library or top&ndash;level
program, are treated as a set of <code>letrec*</code> bindings.  In addition,
for library bodies, the variables exported from the library can be
referenced by importing libraries and top&ndash;level programs.

   <p>Expressions that bind keywords include the <code>let-syntax</code> and
<code>letrec-syntax</code> forms.  A <code>define</code> form is a definition that
creates a variable binding, and a <code>define-syntax</code> form is a
definition that creates a keyword binding.

   <p>Scheme is a statically scoped language with block structure.  To each
place in a top&ndash;level program or library body where an identifier is
bound there corresponds a <dfn>region</dfn> of code within which the binding
is visible.  The region is determined by the particular binding
construct that establishes the binding; if the binding is established by
a <code>lambda</code> expression, for example, then its region is the entire
<code>lambda</code> expression.  Every mention of an identifier refers to the
binding of the identifier that establishes the innermost of the regions
containing the use.  If a use of an identifier appears in a place where
none of the surrounding expressions contains a binding for the
identifier, the use may refer to a binding established by a definition
or import at the top of the enclosing library or top&ndash;level program.  If
there is no binding for the identifier, it is said to be <dfn>unbound</dfn>.
