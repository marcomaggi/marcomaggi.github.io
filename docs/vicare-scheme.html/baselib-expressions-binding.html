experimental support for 64-bit machines.  _Vicare_ is pronounced
the etruscan way.

<h4 class="subsection">4.4.6 Binding constructs</h4>

<p>The binding constructs described in this section create local bindings
for variables that are visible only in a delimited region.  The syntax
of the constructs <code>let</code>, <code>let*</code>, <code>letrec</code>, and
<code>letrec*</code> is identical, but they differ in the regions they
establish for their variable bindings and in the order in which the
values for the bindings are computed.

     <ul>
<li>In a <code>let</code> expression, the initial values are computed before any
of the variables become bound; in a <code>let*</code> expression, the bindings
and evaluations are performed sequentially.

     <li>In a <code>letrec</code> or <code>letrec*</code> expression, all the bindings are in
effect while their initial values are being computed, thus allowing
mutually recursive definitions.

     <li>In a <code>letrec</code> expression, the initial values are computed before
being assigned to the variables; in a <code>letrec*</code>, the evaluations
and assignments are performed sequentially. 
</ul>

   <p>In addition, the binding constructs <code>let-values</code> and
<code>let*-values</code> generalize <code>let</code> and <code>let*</code> to allow
multiple variables to be bound to the results of expressions that
evaluate to multiple values.  They are analogous to <code>let</code> and
<code>let*</code> in the way they establish regions: in a <code>let-values</code>
expression, the initial values are computed before any of the variables
become bound; in a <code>let*-values</code> expression, the bindings are
performed sequentially.

        <p>The <var>?init</var>s are evaluated in the current environment (in some

evaluated and bindings created sequentially from left to right, with the
region of each binding including the bindings to its right as well as
<var>?body</var>.  Thus the second <var>?init</var> is evaluated in an environment
in which the first binding is visible and initialized, and so on.

and the values of the last expression in <var>?body</var> are returned.  Each
binding of a <var>?variable</var> has the entire <code>letrec</code> expression as
its region, making it possible to define mutually recursive procedures.

     <pre class="example">          (letrec ((even?

</pre>
        <p>It should be possible to evaluate each <var>?init</var> without assigning or
referring to the value of any <var>?variable</var>.  In the most common uses
of <code>letrec</code>, all the <var>?init</var>s are <code>lambda</code>s and the
restriction is satisfied automatically.  Another restriction is that the
continuation of each <var>?init</var> should not be invoked more than once.

        <p><strong>Implementation responsibilities:</strong> Implementations must detect
references to a <var>?variable</var> during the evaluation of the <var>?init</var>
expressions (using one particular evaluation order and order of
evaluating the <var>?init</var> expressions).  If an implementation detects
such a violation of the restriction, it must raise an exception with
condition type <code>&amp;assertion</code>.  Implementations may or may not detect
that the continuation of each <var>?init</var> is invoked more than once. 
However, if the implementation detects this, it must raise an exception
with condition type <code>&amp;assertion</code>.
