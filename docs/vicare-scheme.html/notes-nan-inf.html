<h4 class="appendixsubsec">K.1.1 How to deal with infinities</h4>


<p>Infinities can appear as literals in Scheme source code as &lsquo;<samp>+inf.0</samp>&rsquo;
or &lsquo;<samp>-inf.0</samp>&rsquo;, and they can be the result of an expression composing
Scheme arithmetic functions.
</p>
<p>We have to distinguish between <em>number objects</em> as defined in
<acronym>R6RS</acronym> Scheme, and <em>numbers</em> as defined by Mathematics.
</p>

<a name="Infinities-in-the-mathematical-realm"></a>
<h4 class="subsubheading">Infinities in the mathematical realm</h4>

<p>We can take that Algebra defines <em>groups</em> as couples <em>(S, o)</em>
where: <em>S</em> is a set of mathematical entities, <em>o</em> is an
operation that composes two entities in <em>S</em> and evaluates to some
mathematical entity.  We can define the group <em>(R, +)</em>, where
<em>R</em> is the set of real numbers and <em>+</em> is the common addition,
because they are compliant with the following axioms:
</p>
<dl compact="compact">
<dt><em>Closure</em></dt>
<dd><p>For every couple of reals, their sum is a real.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><em>Associativity</em></dt>
<dd><p>For every triplet of reals:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">a + (b + c) = (a + b) + c
</pre></div>

</dd>
<dt><em>Identity element</em></dt>
<dd><p>There exists a unique real <em>0</em> for which, for every real <em>a</em>:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">0 + a = a + 0 = a
</pre></div>

</dd>
<dt><em>Inverse element</em></dt>
<dd><p>For every real <em>a</em> there is a unique other real <em>b</em> for which:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">a + b = 0  &rArr;  a = -b
</pre></div>
</dd>
</dl>

<p>the existence of the inverse element for addition allows the definition
of subtraction.  The couple <em>(R, *)</em>, the reals with the ordinary
product, is also a group:
</p>
<dl compact="compact">
<dt><em>Closure</em></dt>
<dd><div class="example">
<pre class="example">\forall a, b \in R     a * b = c   c \in R
</pre></div>

</dd>
<dt><em>Associativity</em></dt>
<dd><div class="example">
<pre class="example">a * (b * c) = (a * b) * c
</pre></div>

</dd>
<dt><em>Identity element</em></dt>
<dd><div class="example">
<pre class="example">1 * a = a * 1 = a
</pre></div>

</dd>
<dt><em>Inverse element</em></dt>
<dd><div class="example">
<pre class="example">a * b = 1  &rArr;  a = 1/b
</pre></div>
</dd>
</dl>

<p>the existence of the inverse element for multiplication allows the
definition of division.
</p>
<p>The triplet <em>(S, +, *)</em> in which <em>S</em> is a set of mathematical
entities, and <em>+</em> and <em>*</em> are composition operations with the
properties for a group, is called <em>field</em> if the following
additional axioms hold:
</p>
<dl compact="compact">
<dt><em>Commutativity</em></dt>
<dd><div class="example">
<pre class="example">a + b = b + a    a * b = b * a
</pre></div>

</dd>
<dt><em>Distributivity</em></dt>
<dd><div class="example">
<pre class="example">a * (b + c) = a * b + a * c
</pre></div>
</dd>
</dl>

<p>Human experience shows that it is convenient to state (simplified):
Every mathematical entity which is not compliant with the axioms of a
field is not a number.
</p>
<p>Infinities are abstract mathematical entities which we can define
through the following disequations:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">\forall r \in R        -\infty &lt; r &lt; +\infty
</pre></div>

<p>which means:
</p>
<ul>
<li> Positive infinity is comparable to numbers and it is greater than all
the positive numbers.

</li><li> Negative infinity is comparable to numbers and it is lesser than all the
negative number.
</li></ul>

<p>we notice that the comparison operator <em>&lt;</em> does not define a group,
because the result of <em>1 &lt; 2</em> (as defined in Mathematics) is a
boolean value not a number.<a name="DOCF6" href="#FOOT6"><sup>6</sup></a>
</p>
<p>Despite the fact that we can compare them to numbers, <strong>infinities
are not numbers in the Mathematics sense.</strong>  We can show this with the
following simple mathematical computation; let&rsquo;s consider the following
equation:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">4 + +\infty = x
</pre></div>

<p>what should we take as value for <em>x</em>?  <em>x</em> cannot be a number
like, say, <em>8</em>, because:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">4 + +\infty = 8
&rArr; +\infty = 8 - 4 = 4
&rArr; +\infty = 4  Wrong!
</pre></div>

<p>the only answer that tries to make some sense is <em>x = +\infty</em>, but
then:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">4 + +\infty = +\infty
&rArr;  4 = +\infty - +\infty = 0
&rArr;  4 = 0  Wrong!
</pre></div>

<p>if we assume that infinities are numbers, some perfectly legal algebraic
manipulation yields a wrong result.  Human beings define mathematical
entities based on their usefulness; human experience shows that it is
more useful to avoid absurd equations like <em>4 = 0</em>, than to define
infinities as numbers.
</p>
<p>So, infinities are <strong>not</strong> numbers and the equation <em>4 +
\infty = x</em> is wrong in the sense that, in Mathematics, it is an error
to write it.
</p>
<p>Mathematics is not &ldquo;perfect&rdquo;, in the sense that it allows us to write
wrong equations; unfortunately we can recognise an equation as wrong
only by trying to solve it.
</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s look at this equation:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">   4 - 3       1
------------ = - = x
12 - (4 + 8)   0
</pre></div>

<p>what should we take as value for <em>x</em>?
</p>
<p>If we had the limit:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">         1
\lim    --- = x      t &gt; 0
t -&gt; 0   t
</pre></div>

<p>we would know that <em>x -&gt; +\infty</em> (<em>x</em> approaches
<em>+\infty</em>, it is not equal to it).  Computing <em>1 / t</em> for
<em>t</em> smaller and smaller, yields a result that is a bigger and
bigger positive number, which approaches the mathematical entity greater
than all the positive numbers; that is <em>+\infty</em>.
</p>
<p>But what about the straight <em>1 / 0 = x</em>?  The only mathematical
entity that makes sense as answer is <em>x = +\infty</em>, so <em>1 / 0</em>
is not a number.  We can demonstrate this with the following simple
computation:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">3 * (1 / 0) = y
&rArr;  3 / 0 = y
&rArr;  3 = y * 0 = 0
&rArr;  3 = 0   Wrong!
</pre></div>

<p>so, it is impossible for <em>1 / 0</em> and <em>y</em> to comply with the
axioms.
</p>

<a name="Infinities-in-the-computer-realm"></a>
<h4 class="subsubheading">Infinities in the computer realm</h4>

<p>Number objects are all the Scheme values for which the predicate
<code>number?</code> returns <code>#t</code>.  Both the infinities &lsquo;<samp>+inf.0</samp>&rsquo; and
&lsquo;<samp>-inf.0</samp>&rsquo; are number objects.  This way Scheme defines a class of
values which can be used as arguments to arithmetic procedures, and
which can potentially be the return value of an arithmetic procedure.
</p>
<p>We acknowledged that, when a mathematical expression is non&ndash;compliant
with the axioms of definition of numbers, we can verify it by doing the
computation and checking the final or partial results.  A computer can
do the same by detecting, for example, if a division has <em>1</em> and
<em>0</em> as operands.
</p>
<p>It turns out that making a computer processor interrupt a computation
when an expression is wrong, is inefficient.  So two special values were
defined to allow a computation to signal that special error:
&lsquo;<samp>+inf.0</samp>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<samp>-inf.0</samp>&rsquo;.
</p>
<p>When a computation returns &lsquo;<samp>+inf.0</samp>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<samp>-inf.0</samp>&rsquo; we know that
the expression was wrong.  <acronym>R6RS</acronym> Scheme defines the following
conventional results:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">(div 1 0) &rArr; error
(/   1 0) &rArr; error

(/   1.0 0)   &rArr; +inf.0
(/   1   0.0) &rArr; +inf.0
(/   1.0 0.0) &rArr; +inf.0
</pre></div>

<p>when both the operands are exact, the expression raises an error; when
one of the operands is inexact, the expression yields infinity.
</p>
<p>Special rules were defined to avoid to mistake a wrong computation for a
correct one; for example:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">(+ 44 (* 23 +inf.0)) &rArr; +inf.0
(+ 44 (* 23 -inf.0)) &rArr; -inf.0
</pre></div>

<p>we know that both of these are wrong, but we also know that they are
wrong in that special way for which returning an infinity makes some
sense.  It is our responsibility to decide what to do.
</p>
<p>The special rules makes it impossible for an expression to return a
finite number if one of the partial results was an infinity.  Sometimes
the composition of two infinities can yield an infinity with no
confusion; examples:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">(+ +inf.0 +inf.0) &rArr; +inf.0
(+ -inf.0 -inf.0) &rArr; -inf.0

(- +inf.0 -inf.0) &rArr; +inf.0  ;like (+ +inf.0 +inf.0)
(- -inf.0 +inf.0) &rArr; -inf.0  ;like (+ -inf.0 -inf.0)
(- +inf.0 -inf.0) &rArr; +inf.0  ;like (+ +inf.0 +inf.0)

(* +inf.0 +inf.0) &rArr; -inf.0
(* +inf.0 -inf.0) &rArr; -inf.0
(* -inf.0 -inf.0) &rArr; +inf.0
</pre></div>

<p>but some expressions are difficult to deal with:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">(+ +inf.0 -inf.0) &rArr; ?
(+ -inf.0 +inf.0) &rArr; ?

(- -inf.0 -inf.0) &rArr; ?
(- -inf.0 +inf.0) &rArr; ?

(/ +inf.0 +inf.0) &rArr; ?
(/ +inf.0 -inf.0) &rArr; ?
(/ -inf.0 +inf.0) &rArr; ?
(/ -inf.0 -inf.0) &rArr; ?
</pre></div>

<p>neither a number nor an infinity makes sense as result here; we need
NaN.
