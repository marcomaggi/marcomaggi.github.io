<a name="Hygiene"></a>
<h4 class="subsection">5.12.2 Hygiene</h4>


<p>Barendregt&rsquo;s <em>hygiene condition</em> for the lambda calculus is an
informal notion that requires the free variables of an expression
<em>N</em> that is to be substituted into another expression <em>M</em> not
to be captured by bindings in <em>M</em> when such capture is not
intended.
</p>
<p>Kohlbecker, et al. propose a corresponding <em>hygiene condition for
macro expansion</em> that applies in all situations where capturing is not
explicit: &ldquo;Generated identifiers that become binding instances in the
completely expanded program must only bind variables that are generated
at the same transcription step&rdquo;.  In the terminology of this document,
the &ldquo;generated identifiers&rdquo; are those introduced by a transformer
rather than those present in the form passed to the transformer, and a
&ldquo;macro transcription step&rdquo; corresponds to a single call by the
expander to a transformer.  Also, the hygiene condition applies to all
introduced bindings rather than to introduced variable bindings alone.
</p>
<p>This leaves open what happens to an introduced identifier that appears
outside the scope of a binding introduced by the same call.  Such an
identifier refers to the lexical binding in effect where it appears
(within a <code>syntax</code> <var>?template</var>) inside the transformer body or
one of the helpers it calls.  This is essentially the referential
transparency property described by Clinger and Rees.  Thus, the hygiene
condition can be restated as follows:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A binding for an identifier introduced into the output of a transformer
call from the expander must capture only references to the identifier
introduced into the output of the same transformer call.
</p>
<p>A reference to an identifier introduced into the output of a transformer
refers to the closest enclosing binding for the introduced identifier
or, if it appears outside of any enclosing binding for the introduced
identifier, the closest enclosing lexical binding where the identifier
appears (within a <code>syntax</code> <var>?template</var>) inside the transformer
body or one of the helpers it calls.
</p></blockquote>

<p>Explicit captures are handled via <code>datum-&gt;syntax</code>.
</p>
<p>Operationally, the expander can maintain hygiene with the help of
<em>marks</em>.  Marks are applied selectively by the expander to the
output of each transformer it invokes, and substitutions are applied to
the portions of each binding form that are supposed to be within the
scope of the bound identifiers.  Marks are used to distinguish
like&ndash;named identifiers that are introduced at different times (either
present in the source or introduced into the output of a particular
transformer call), and substitutions are used to map identifiers to
their expand-time values.
</p>
<p>Each time the expander encounters a macro use, it applies an
<em>antimark</em> to the input form, invokes the associated transformer,
then applies a fresh mark to the output.  Marks and antimarks cancel, so
the portions of the input that appear in the output are effectively left
unmarked, while the portions of the output that are introduced are
marked with the fresh mark.
</p>
<p>Each time the expander encounters a binding form it creates a set of
substitutions, each mapping one of the (possibly marked) bound
identifiers to information about the binding.  (For a <code>lambda</code>
expression, the expander might map each bound identifier to a
representation of the formal parameter in the output of the expander.
For a <code>let-syntax</code> form, the expander might map each bound
identifier to the associated transformer.)  These substitutions are
applied to the portions of the input form in which the binding is
supposed to be visible.
</p>
<p>Marks and substitutions together form a <em>wrap</em> that is layered on
the form being processed by the expander and pushed down toward the
leaves as necessary.  A wrapped form is referred to as a <em>wrapped
syntax object</em>.  Ultimately, the wrap may rest on a leaf that represents
an identifier, in which case the wrapped syntax object is also referred
to as an <em>identifier</em>.  An identifier contains a name along with
the wrap.  (Names are typically represented by symbols.)
</p>
<p>When a substitution is created to map an identifier to an expand&ndash;time
value, the substitution records the name of the identifier and the set
of marks that have been applied to that identifier, along with the
associated expand&ndash;time value.  The expander resolves identifier
references by looking for the latest matching substitution to be applied
to the identifier, i.e., the outermost substitution in the wrap whose
name and marks match the name and marks recorded in the substitution.
The name matches if it is the same name (if using symbols, then by
<code>eq?</code>), and the marks match if the marks recorded with the
substitution are the same as those that appear <em>below</em> the
substitution in the wrap, i.e., those that were applied <em>before</em>
the substitution.  Marks applied after a substitution, i.e., appear over
the substitution in the wrap, are not relevant and are ignored.
</p>
<p>An algebra that defines how marks and substitutions work more precisely
is given in section 2.4 of Oscar Waddell&rsquo;s PhD thesis.  Note, however,
that Waddell&rsquo;s thesis describes slightly different semantics for
<code>bound-identifier=?</code>, it specifies that for two identifiers to be
equal in the sense of <code>bound-identifier=?</code>, they must have the same
marks and be equal in the sense of <code>free-identifier=?</code>, whereas
this report requires instead that they must have the same marks and have
the same name.
