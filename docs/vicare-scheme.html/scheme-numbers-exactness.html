<a name="Exactness"></a>
<h4 class="subsection">3.3.2 Exactness</h4>


<p>It is useful to distinguish between number objects that are known to
correspond to a number exactly, and those number objects whose
computation involved rounding or other errors.  For example, index
operations into data structures may need to know the index exactly, as
may some operations on polynomial coefficients in a symbolic algebra
system.  On the other hand, the results of measurements are inherently
inexact, and irrational numbers may be approximated by rational and
therefore inexact approximations.  In order to catch uses of numbers
known only inexactly where exact numbers are required, Scheme explicitly
distinguishes <em>exact</em> from <em>inexact</em> number objects.  This
distinction is orthogonal to the dimension of type.
</p>
<p>A number object is exact if it is the value of an exact numerical
literal or was derived from exact number objects using only exact
operations.  Exact number objects correspond to mathematical numbers in
the obvious way.
</p>
<p>Conversely, a number object is inexact if it is the value of an inexact
numerical literal, or was derived from inexact number objects, or was
derived using inexact operations.  Thus inexactness is contagious.
</p>
<p>Exact arithmetic is reliable in the following sense: If exact number
objects are passed to any of the arithmetic procedures described in
<a href="baselib-math-exactness.html#baselib-math-exactness">Propagation of exactness and inexactness</a>,
and an exact number object is returned, then the result is
mathematically correct.  This is generally not true of computations
involving inexact number objects because approximate methods such as
floating&ndash;point arithmetics may be used, but it is the duty of each
implementation to make the result as close as practical to the
mathematically ideal result.
