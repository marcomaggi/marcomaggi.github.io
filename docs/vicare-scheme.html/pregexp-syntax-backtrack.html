This document describes version 0.3d4 of Vicare Scheme, an
R6RS compliant native compiler for the Scheme language, producing
single threaded programs running on Intel x86 32-bit processors, with
experimental support for 64-bit machines.  _Vicare_ is pronounced
the etruscan way.

<h4 class="subsection">28.3.6 Backtracking</h4>

<p>We've already seen that greedy quantifiers match the maximal number of
times, but the overriding priority is that the overall match
succeed.  Consider:

<pre class="example">     (pregexp-match "a*a" "aaaa")
</pre>
   <p>The regexp consists of two subregexps, <code>a*</code> followed by <code>a</code>. 
The subregexp <code>a*</code> cannot be allowed to match all four <code>a</code>'s
in the text string <code>aaaa</code>, even though <code>*</code> is a greedy
quantifier.  It may match only the first three, leaving the last one for
the second subregexp.  This ensures that the full regexp matches
successfully.

   <p>The regexp matcher accomplishes this via a process called backtracking. 
The matcher tentatively allows the greedy quantifier to match all four
<code>a</code>'s, but then when it becomes clear that the overall match is in
jeopardy, it backtracks to a less greedy match of three <code>a</code>'s.  If
even this fails, as in the call:

<pre class="example">     (pregexp-match "a*aa" "aaaa")
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">the matcher backtracks even further.  Overall failure is conceded only
when all possible backtracking has been tried with no success.

   <p>Backtracking is not restricted to greedy quantifiers.  Nongreedy
quantifiers match as few instances as possible, and progressively
backtrack to more and more instances in order to attain an overall
match.  There is backtracking in alternation too, as the more rightward
alternates are tried when locally successful leftward ones fail to yield
an overall match.

<!--  -->
<h5 class="subsubheading">Disabling backtracking</h5>

<p>Sometimes it is efficient to disable backtracking.  For example, we may
wish to commit to a choice, or we know that trying alternatives is
fruitless.  A nonbacktracking regexp is enclosed in <code>(?&gt;...)</code>.

<pre class="example">     (pregexp-match "(?&gt;a+)." "aaaa")
     &rArr; #f
</pre>
   <p>In this call, the subregexp <code>?&gt;a+</code> greedily matches all four
<code>a</code>'s, and is denied the opportunity to backpedal.  So the overall
match is denied.  The effect of the regexp is therefore to match one or
more <code>a</code>'s followed by something that is definitely non&ndash;<code>a</code>.
