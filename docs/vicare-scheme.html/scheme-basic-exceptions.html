This document describes version 0.3d7 of Vicare Scheme, an
R6RS compliant native compiler for the Scheme language, producing
single threaded programs running on Intel x86 32-bit processors, with
experimental support for 64-bit machines.  _Vicare_ is pronounced
the etruscan way.

<h4 class="subsection">3.5.3 Exceptional situations</h4>

<p>A variety of exceptional situations are distinguished in this report,
among them violations of syntax, violations of a procedure's
specification, violations of implementation restrictions, and
exceptional situations in the environment.  When an exceptional
situation is detected by the implementation, an <em>exception is
raised</em>, which means that a special procedure called the <em>current
exception handler</em> is called.  A program can also raise an exception,
and override the current exception handler; <a href="stdlib-exceptions.html#stdlib-exceptions">stdlib exceptions</a>.

   <p>When an exception is raised, an object is provided that describes the
nature of the exceptional situation.  The report uses the condition
system described in library section &ldquo;Conditions&rdquo; to describe
exceptional situations, classifying them by condition types.

   <p>Some exceptional situations allow continuing the program if the
exception handler takes appropriate action.  The corresponding
exceptions are called <em>continuable</em>.  For most of the exceptional
situations described in this report, portable programs cannot rely upon
the exception being continuable at the place where the situation was
detected.  For those exceptions, the exception handler that is invoked
by the exception should not return.  In some cases, however, continuing
is permissible, and the handler may return.  <a href="stdlib-exceptions.html#stdlib-exceptions">stdlib exceptions</a>

   <p>Implementations must raise an exception when they are unable to continue
correct execution of a correct program due to some <em>implementation
restriction</em>.  For example, an implementation that does not support
infinities must raise an exception with condition type
<code>&amp;implementation-restriction</code> when it evaluates an expression whose
result would be an infinity.

   <p>Some possible implementation restrictions such as the lack of
representations for NaNs and infinities are anticipated by this report,
and implementations typically must raise an exception of the appropriate
condition type if they encounter such a situation.

   <p>This report uses the phrase &ldquo;an exception is raised&rdquo; synonymously with
&ldquo;an exception must be raised&rdquo;.  This report uses the phrase &ldquo;an
exception with condition type <var>t</var>&rdquo; to indicate that the object
provided with the exception is a condition object of the specified type. 
The phrase &ldquo;a continuable exception is raised&rdquo; indicates an
exceptional situation that permits the exception handler to return.
