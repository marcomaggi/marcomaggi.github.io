experimental support for 64-bit machines.  _Vicare_ is pronounced
the etruscan way.

<h4 class="subsection">6.32.2 Guardians programming interface</h4>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: <b>make-guardian</b><var><a name="index-make_002dguardian-1492"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>Build and return a new guardian object: a closure that can be called
with one or zero arguments, and that is interfaced with the garbage
collector of Vicare in a non&ndash;portable way.

        <p>The guardian work like this:

          <ul>
<li>When the closure is called with one argument: it adds the argument to an
internal set of &ldquo;guarded values&rdquo;, accessible to the garbage collector;
the return value if the argument itself.

          <li>When the garbage collector detects no other references to a value in the
set of guarded values: the guardian removes it from the set and appends
it to an internal queue (<acronym>FIFO</acronym>).

          <li>When the closure is called with zero arguments: it removes the first
value from the internal queue and returns it; if no values are in the
queue it returns <code>#f</code>. 
</ul>

        <p>After an object has been returned by the guardian, it is no more
&ldquo;guarded&rdquo; so it will be garbage collected when it will become
inaccessible (unless it is again registered in a guardian).

        <blockquote>
<strong>NOTE</strong> It is possible to register an object in more than one
guardian; when the object is found inaccessible all the guardian
closures that have it will return it to the caller.  This may lead to
invalid finalisation operations, it is the responsibility of the
programmer to avoid this. 
</blockquote>

        <blockquote>
<strong>NOTE</strong> It is possible to register an object multiple times in the
same guardian; when the object is found inaccessible the guardian
closure that has it will return it to the caller multiple times.  This
may lead to invalid finalisation operations, it is the responsibility of
the programmer to avoid this.

        </p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Parameter: <b>post-gc-hooks</b><var><a name="index-post_002dgc_002dhooks-1493"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>Hold a list of thunks evaluated after each garbage collection run.  It
can be used to run a guardian cleanup function like this (using the
example in the previous section):

     <pre class="example">          (define (run-block-guardian)
            (do ((p (block-guardian) (block-guardian)))
                ((not p))
              (free p)))
          
          (post-gc-hooks
           (cons run-block-guardian
            (post-gc-hooks)))
</pre>
