This document describes version 0.3d4 of Vicare Scheme, an
R6RS compliant native compiler for the Scheme language, producing
single threaded programs running on Intel x86 32-bit processors, with
experimental support for 64-bit machines.  _Vicare_ is pronounced
the etruscan way.

<h4 class="subsection">3.5.1 Programs and libraries</h4>

<p>A Scheme program consists of a <em>top&ndash;level</em> program together with a
set of <em>libraries</em>, each of which defines a part of the program
connected to the others through explicitly specified exports and
imports.

     <ul>
<li>A library consists of a set of export and import specifications and a
body, which consists of definitions, and expressions.

     <li>A top&ndash;level program is similar to a library, but has no export
specifications. 
</ul>

   <p>Chapters &ldquo;Libraries&rdquo; and &ldquo;Top&ndash;level programs&rdquo; describe the syntax
and semantics of libraries and top&ndash;level programs, respectively. 
Chapter &ldquo;Base library&rdquo; describes a base library that defines many of
the constructs traditionally associated with Scheme.  A separate report
describes the various <em>standard libraries</em> provided by a Scheme
system.

   <p>The division between the base library and the other standard libraries
is based on use, not on construction.  In particular, some facilities
that are typically implemented as &ldquo;primitives&rdquo; by a compiler or the
run&ndash;time system rather than in terms of other standard procedures or
syntactic forms are not part of the base library, but are defined in
separate libraries.  Examples include the fixnums and flonums libraries,
the exceptions and conditions libraries, and the libraries for records.
