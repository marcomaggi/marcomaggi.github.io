The package supports POSIX platforms.  This package should work with Cyclone version
0.17.  To run the test suite this package depends upon the external package:
MMUX Cyclone Checks, at least version 0.1.0.

<span id="How-generic-functions-and-methods-are-invoked"></span><h3 class="section">9.1 How generic functions and methods are invoked</h3>


<p><code>(scmobj)</code> allows the definition of four kinds of methods:
<code>:primary</code>, <code>:around</code>, <code>:before</code> and <code>:after</code>.  The
short description is that <code>:around</code> methods are applied first, then
<code>:before</code>, <code>:primary</code> and <code>:after</code> methods are applied in
this order.
</p>
<p>When a generic function is applied to a tuple of arguments, the
following happens:
</p>
<ol>
<li> For each argument in the tuple a class is determined.  The tuple of
classes is called <em>signature</em>.
</li></ol>

<p>For each kind of method, the generic function maintains an internal
collection in which every method&rsquo;s closure is associated to a signature.
</p>
<ol start="2">
<li> For each kind of method: The internal collection is queried for all the
methods applicable to the tuple of arguments, using the signature as
search key.

</li><li> For each kind of method: The list of applicable methods is sorted from
the more specific to the least specific for the signature.  The list of
<code>:after</code> methods is reversed.
</li></ol>

<p>From now on the lists of sorted, applicable methods are handled as
stacks; the stacks of <code>:primary</code>, <code>:around</code> and <code>:before</code>
methods have most specific method on the top; the stack of <code>:after</code>
methods has the least specific method on the top.
</p>
<p>From now on the application of the generic function enters an implicit
loop in which more methods&rsquo; closures can be applied to the same tuple of
arguments.  The loop can terminate if a method&rsquo;s closure throws an
exception or, for <code>:around</code> and <code>:primary</code> methods, if it does
not take the special action of calling <code>call-next-method</code>.
</p>
<p>The loop is a bit articulated, so we may have to read the following
descriptions multiple times.  We split the description in two branches:
First a simplified invocation for generic functions having at least one
applicable <code>:primary</code> method, no <code>:around</code> methods, and
performing no calls to <code>call-next-method</code>; then the full
application algorithm.
</p>
<p>Here is the simplified branch with no <code>:around</code> methods and no
calls to <code>call-next-method</code>:
</p>
<ol start="4">
<li> Pop all the <code>:before</code> methods from the stack and apply their
closures to the tuple of arguments.  The return values of these
applications are discarded.

</li><li> Pop the next <code>:primary</code> method from the stack and apply its closure
to the tuple of arguments.  The return value of this application is
saved in a temporary location.

</li><li> Pop all the <code>:after</code> methods from the stack and apply their
closures to the tuple of arguments.  The return values of these
applications are discarded.

</li><li> Return the saved return value of the <code>:primary</code> method.
</li></ol>

<p>Here is the full application algorithm:
</p>
<ol start="4">
<li> Test if this function application originated from a call to
<code>call-next-method</code> from a <code>:before</code> or <code>:after</code> method.
If it has: Raise an assertion violation.

</li><li> Test if this function application originated from a call to
<code>call-next-method</code> from a <code>:primary</code> method.  If it has:

<ol type="a" start="1">
<li> If the stack of <code>:primary</code> methods is empty raise an assertion
violation.

</li><li> Pop the next <code>:primary</code> method from the stack and apply its closure
to the tuple of arguments.

</li><li> Break out returning the return value of this application: It becomes the
return value of <code>call-next-method</code>.
</li></ol>

</li><li> If the stack of <code>:primary</code> methods is empty: Raise an assertion
violation.  This condition means that the generic function has no
applicable methods for the tuple of arguments.

</li><li> If the stack of <code>:around</code> methods is not empty: Pop the next
<code>:around</code> method and apply its closure to the tuple of arguments.
Break out returning the return value of this application.

</li><li> Pop all the <code>:before</code> methods from the stack and apply their
closures to the tuple of arguments.  The return values of these
applications are discarded.

</li><li> Pop the next <code>:primary</code> method from the stack and apply its closure
to the tuple of arguments.  The return value of this application is
saved in a temporary location.

</li><li> Pop all the <code>:after</code> methods from the stack and apply their
closures to the tuple of arguments.  The return values of these
applications are discarded.

</li><li> Return the saved return value of the <code>:primary</code> method.
</li></ol>

<p>The <code>:primary</code> methods are meant to do the real work of the
function.  Only the most specific is applied to the arguments, however
it can use <code>call-next-method</code> to invoke a least specialised version
and use its return value.
</p>
<p><code>:before</code> and <code>:after</code> methods are meant to execute additional
work before and after the primary methods.  While <code>:before</code> methods
are applied from the most specific to the least specific, <code>:after</code>
methods are applied from the least specific to the most specific.
Notice that the <code>:after</code> methods have no access to the return value
of the <code>:primary</code> methods.
</p>
<p><code>:around</code> methods are yet another level for performing tasks before
and after the primary methods; only the most specific is applied to the
arguments.  It is expected, but not mandatory, that an <code>:around</code>
method invokes <code>call-next-method</code>; such invocations will consume
all the applicable <code>:around</code> methods, from the least to the most
specific, and then will start the application of <code>:before</code>,
<code>:primary</code> and <code>:after</code> methods.
