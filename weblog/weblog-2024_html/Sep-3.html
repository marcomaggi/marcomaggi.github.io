<p>Pervasive demand avoidance.  I have no trouble admitting it exists, I have seen things.
</p>
<p>Either I do not have it, or I learned to manage it when I was young.
</p>
<p>When teenagers have it: it&rsquo;s ugly.
</p>
<p>When old people have it: it&rsquo;s worse.
</p>
<p>I refuse to believe it is invincible.
</p>
<p>One could think that teenagers would be more proactive in managing it, because they are young and
full of energy.  They are not.
</p>
<p>One could think that adults would be more eager to manage it, year after year, because they know the
consequences.  They are not.
</p>
<p>There are some killer combinations: &ldquo;I will do nothing, unless someone tells me what to do.  If you
tell me what to do, I will not do it because it restricts my freedom.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>There are other, less fascinating, situations: if you have to take care of someone else, it requires
you to do what is needed, not what you want.  &ldquo;Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  I do what I want!  If someone needs
care, it is not my problem!&rdquo;  Joyful existence ensues.
</p>
<p>If you have it and you blame other people for the consequences: you are evil.  Being weak in your
mind is not an excuse; even in a weak mind there is room for the sense of justice.
</p>
<p>In my opinion, when dealing with people that have it: the worst is not knowing what&rsquo;s going on.
Knowledge makes you better.  If I know that this exists, it is because I use the Net to feed me some
random knowledge.  Random knowledge makes you better.
