</p>

<p>I have started a new project; it is a C language library implementing personal finance computations
about a very narrow subject; from the point of view of software engineering: it is a very simple
project.  It is unlikely that I will actually use this project in my personal finance accounting,
but writing code helps me to understand how financial instruments work and where the money goes;
it&rsquo;s executable mathematics.
</p>
<p>There are complications.
</p><ol class="enumerate">
<li> I have not written a single line of C language code in a long time; I do not even remember the last
time I touched some code.  2020?  2021?  My mind buried a lot of knowledge about programming and the
C language in particular; I have to dig it up.
</li><li> Even though the new code is simple: I do want to reuse my software packaging infrastructure.  This
means: <abbr class="acronym">gnu</abbr> Autotools, <code class="command">git</code> revision control, projects at GitHub and Bitbucket.  My mind
buried knowledge about this stuff, too.
</li><li> Even though the new code is simple: I do want to reuse my C language infrastructure libraries; I
wrote them to make developing new projects simpler!  These are a collection of projects that I named
<em class="emph">CCLibraries</em>; these projects are in bad shape: I have to restructure them, move code around,
exclude code that I wrote because of bad choices that resulted in failure; I also want to rename all
of them because the naming prefix &lsquo;<samp class="samp">cc</samp>&rsquo; is not good: I will prefix everything with &lsquo;<samp class="samp">mmux_</samp>&rsquo;,
which is more personal.
</li></ol>

<p>I&rsquo;m trying to pull me out of burnout and this is exactly the kind of project I need; it is hard to
find resources in my brain; I have amassed a queue of things to do and I struggle to process it; I
established priorities, but I got stuck; I want to get something going; maybe changing the
priorities will help.
