<p>I&rsquo;ve been in burnout before, I know the theory; I need projects to get out of it; but everything
happens slowly.  If I move on with a project, the feeling of accomplishment creates momentum and
everything else goes on with it; I wanted to begin a project about personal finance and some C
language software components; I did not even start it.  But!  I did resume developing <abbr class="acronym">mbfl</abbr> and I
did expunge some of the tasks from my to&ndash;do queue.
</p>
<p>About <abbr class="acronym">mbfl</abbr>: ideas were aligning in my last development session, I&rsquo;m pushing forward from there.
I did realise I selected the wrong conventions for some names in the public <abbr class="acronym">api</abbr>; this hurts!  I
use the very latest in my desktop infrastructure of <abbr class="acronym">gnu</abbr> Bash scripts: errors like these force me
to sweep all my code for fixes.  Even more disappointing is that I should have known from the start:
I already used a better convention in other projects; why did I not reuse it?  Because!
</p>
<p>I also have some problems with the documentation: if I cannot write organised documentation, it
means something is wrong with the design; or I do not have a good understanding of the concepts; or
I&rsquo;m paranoid.  With the latest restructuring, it seems progress is possible.
</p>
<p>I also have another project as a batch process in the background of my brain.  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!
</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s about an application of well known mathematical concepts; I believe my intuition got the core
mathematics right; but I need to refresh some theory I studied a long time ago; it will take
patience to confirm if my intuition is right.
</p>
<p>One of my historical weaknesses was computing uneasy integrals: I hated it.  Now there&rsquo;s software
that numerically integrates almost anything; that&rsquo;s liberating.  I can look at integrand functions
and scorn them: &ldquo;You talking to me?  You talking to me?&rdquo;
</p>
<p>I have no use for a full <a class="url" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolfram_Mathematica"><em class="emph">Wolfram
Mathematica</em></a> licence, but I occasionally enjoy playing with <a class="url" href="https://www.wolframalpha.com/"><em class="emph">WolframAlpha</em></a>.  I will use its integration algorithms to verify the results; then I want to
write some C language code.
