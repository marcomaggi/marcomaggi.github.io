<p>This is not a thematic weblog, it is my weblog; I do not want to make it a political weblog; I also
do not want to live in the magical world of Fantasystan, where nothing touches me.
</p>
<p>Death is feasting in Palestine; there&rsquo;s been a war going on since the creation of Israel; a single
endless war; some people were killed even before World War II; war is a series of atrocities;
there&rsquo;s been many of them.
</p>
<p>I generally despise Muslim culture, but I cannot ignore that every report I have read states that:
from the beginning of this single war, many more Palestinians were killed than Israelis were killed.
</p>
<p>There are useless debates about who is Right and who is Wrong; after all the atrocities: nobody can
be Right, everybody is Wrong.
</p>
<p>Both parties&rsquo; cultures have deep roots in religion; you cannot reason with people like that; if a
solution is possible, it will not come from them.
</p>
<p>People from outside also want to adopt some dogma: they pick a side and turn off morality and
critical thinking.
</p>
<p>Is there anyone that actually wants to stop war?
