<p><em>Posted on Mon Mar 20, 2017</em>
</p>

<p>The sun is already up.  A pre&ndash;dawn post would feel more appropriate.  That is the
way it is.
</p>
<p>At some point, many years ago, I decided to forget her.  Yes, as a rational and
conscious decision.  The situation was unbearable.  I was giving her too much power
over me.  Having her as first and last though, and all the thoughts in between, was
consuming.  I was running out of myself.  It was not good.
</p>
<p>I tried to go down a mental path in which I thought less about her.  I tried to build
a Pavlovian conditioning by associating negative thinking to the thinking about her.
My neurons vs. my neurons.
</p>
<p>It was hard.  It was tightrope walking.
</p>
<p>It is like pushing yourself.  How do you push yourself?
</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a memory of a small smile.
