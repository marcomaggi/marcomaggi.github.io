<p>A couple of short stories about italian culture.  Situations like these happen
everywhere, but they are emblematic in Italy.
</p>
<p>Story one.  While attending university, I was sharing rent for an apartment with
other four, young persons; some students, some not; I was not the richest.  Common
expenses were split equally among us: bills, basic supplies (sugar, toilet paper,
light bulbs, &hellip;).
</p>
<p>Someone proposed to periodically (once a month) put some cash in a cash reserve (a
jar &ldquo;hidden&rdquo; in the fridge), so that, when some supply was finished, anyone could
by a new unit without having to rely only on his/her own money.  I voted against, I
lost four to one.
</p>
<p>After a short warm up time span, the scenario stabilises on this: everyone puts in
the same amount of money; we (which means: almost always me) buy stuff; money runs
out; I put in my new share; we buy stuff; money runs out; on a small message
whiteboard we were keeping near the door, I write that we are out of money; after a
while, others put in their share.  Repeat.
</p>
<p>I endured this for a while (it may surprise some, but I <strong class="strong">do</strong> want to use
toilet paper).  Every now and then I was fed up and stopped looking after things.
The unanimous reaction (four to one, remember) was to blame me because I had to warn
them.
</p>
<p>Sod.  Off.  I am sure that there is some psychological/social groups behaviour theory
to explain this dynamic; I am too ignorant to know it.
</p>
<p>Story two.  While attending university, I used train to move between <em class="emph">Cremona</em>
and <em class="emph">Milano</em>.  Occasionally, I ran into a guy I knew; then a laureate in
engineering, he was commuting for his work; a jacket&ndash;and&ndash;tie job.
</p>
<p>Every train carriage has an emergency brake system, which passengers can activate by
pulling a handle; a <em class="emph">new</em> handle usually ends with a pommel: a metal sphere
which has no use other than being a pommel.  The pommel allows a firm grasp of the
handle; if you are weak, for example an old person, you need it because you have to
break a seal to pull the handle.  This guy notices the pommel: &ldquo;Look at this!&rdquo;; he
unscrews it and pockets it.
</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you doing?&rdquo; I ask him, &ldquo;Leave it in place!&rdquo;.
</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want it!&rdquo;, he replies.
</p>
<p>&ldquo;You want it for what?&rdquo;, I enquire.
</p>
<p>&ldquo;I just want it!&rdquo;, he exclaims.
</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you going to do with it?  Keep it on your bedside table?&rdquo;, I am a bit
pissed.
</p>
<p>He shrugs.
</p>
<p>I dunno what to say anymore; I just shut up.  I doubt he is a collector of pommels or
a train enthusiast.
</p>
<p>I am not an Earthling; I come from Vega; fellow Veganians: I know you are among us!
Can someone just pass by and give me a ride home?
