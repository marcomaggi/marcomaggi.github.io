<p><em class="emph">Posted on Sun Mar 19, 2017</em>
</p>

<p>When I started learning how to use personal computers, there was <em class="emph">Microsoft
Works 2.0</em> for MS-DOS (yes, that is <em class="emph">Works</em> not <em class="emph">Word</em>).  It was a textual
application, with textual menus; at some point I could almost recite from memory the
whole menu hierarchy.
</p>
<p>The tree&ndash;like hierarchy of menus was accessible for my mind.
</p>
<p>In later years icons came along: cute, little pictures you do not know what they mean
until you put the pointer over them and read the tooltip.  Today many applications go
crazy with context&ndash;sensitive icon toolbars.  To use such applications your mind has
to be good at associating either little pictures or screen positions with meaning, or
whatever your mind uses to internally represent an &ldquo;application command&rdquo;.  It is
very abstract.
</p>
<p>I am ashamed to admit that such applications defeat me.  Even my father can use some
programs better than me.
</p>
<p>My mind really likes the order of tree&ndash;like hierarchies, especially when there is
only one way to select a command; when two paths, in a system of menus, lead to the
same command: I get nervous.
</p>
<p>Icons and side bars and multiple toolbars annoy me; some are a real pain.
</p>
<p>One of my favourite applications is <abbr class="acronym">gnu</abbr> Emacs.  I use it with a very terse setup:
</p>
<div class="float">
<div class="center"><img class="image" src="img-2017/emacs-2017-Mar-19.png" alt="img-2017/emacs-2017-Mar-19">
</div></div>
<p>No menus, no toolbars, only crazy key bindings and the minibuffer at the bottom: I
organise my Emacs Lisp functions with names having a tree&ndash;like structure.
</p>
<p>Emacs is not mainstream.  <em class="emph">I</em> am not mainstream.
