<p><em>Posted on Jan 29, 2017</em>
</p>

<p>It has been over a month since I upgraded my Acer Aspire V5 laptop to Slackware
version 14.2.  I use the 64-bit distribution with multilib support to also run some
32-bit programs.
</p>
<p>It was a rough fight.  I think I made an error while issuing the basic upgrade
commands and I broke the 14.1 installation I was using.  I had to reinstall
everything.  Not pleasant, but life is hard&hellip;
</p>
<p>Some of the customisation scripts I use had to be fixed, for example for good
handling of ACPI events.  Fine.  Some of the features work better now.
</p>
<p>There is a very disturbing problem: Slackware 14.2 started using
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PulseAudio">PulseAudio</a> to handle everything
audio&ndash;related.  Version 14.1 was using
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Linux_Sound_Architecture">ALSA</a>.
</p>
<p>Under ALSA everything worked.  All the media players were happy.  I could run
multiple copies of Firefox under different user profiles, all playing sound through
the Flash Player and they worked; even when I was already playing music with a
program from the terminal.  Registering volume settings on the file system and
restoring them later worked fine.
</p>
<p>Those days are gone.
</p>
<p>PulseAudio sucks.  It works or not in an unpredictable way (for me).  Volume levels
are reset randomly.  Running multiple sound players under different user accounts
just does not work: it seems programs fight for access to the sound capabilities and
the one that wins cuts out the others.  Sometimes the sound system &ldquo;locks&rdquo; and
there is no way to make it work again: players just crash with &ldquo;cannot connect&rdquo;
error messages.  Most likely, somewhere a lock file is left behind.  I hate this.
</p>
<p>I am really angry because sound capabilities are supposed to be a solved problem.
Why in 2017 do I have live with this?  Damn!
</p>
<p>I wish Slackware could revert to using ALSA.  Most likely it will not happen&hellip;
