<p>I do some bicycling; I&rsquo;m no athlete; I&rsquo;m not even an amateur bicyclist; I just do
some bicycling.  It is sometimes hard to stick to it.
</p>
<p>In Summer I do a mostly out&ndash;of&ndash;town circuit, with some segments of Nature.  This
means inserting my bike into a 15-centimetres-wide mountain-bike trail, with bushes
and nettles scratching me with enthusiasm.  It&rsquo;s fun!  Some segments between fields
are quite boring after the first 100 times: they are straight lines in the open and
the scenery does not change for a while.  For a period of time it was fine: I had
time to think, out of everything.
</p>
<p>In Winter I do a town circuit; I&rsquo;ve built it after several iterations, year after
year, piece by piece, turn by turn; there are a lot of corners to go around.  After
every corner the scenery is different.  I especially like it when there is fog:
bicycling in Winter&rsquo;s foggy darkness is dreamy.  (I do not go through dangerous
neighbourhoods; I stay away from high traffic.)
</p>
<p>If the scenery changes often, you keep going.
