<p><em>Posted on Wed Mar 15, 2017</em>
</p>

<p>A concrete way to evaluate a language that I overlooked for a lot of time: let&rsquo;s say
I have not used a language for weeks or months; now I need it to develop a tool I use
to solve problems in a domain; I have my mind full of the complexities of the
application&rsquo;s domain; I come back to the language; how hard it is to pick it up
again?  What is the intellectual burden of picking up again the syntax and
remembering the core and non&ndash;core concepts?
</p>
<p>For my engineering studies I prepared a lot of notes; I probably have written too
much, but it was inevitable because many important university courses had no written
material covering the whole syllabus (sometimes not even half of it), also some
written material was&hellip; not OK.  I&rsquo;ve also written some notes for personal
interest (too much of those, too).
</p>
<p>More than 10 years ago I typed and developed some of the stuff on a computer using
LaTeX; I value those documents.  Writing on paper is mandatory when trying to find
your way through mathematics applied to engineering, but digital typing the result is
great to put everything in the correct order (and I <strong>really</strong> need the
<strong>correct order</strong>, otherwise I can do nothing).  I went so far as customising
the <code>article</code> style into a <code>scritto</code> style that suited me better.  But
let&rsquo;s not digress.
</p>
<p>I needed to programmatically generate drawings, especially electrical circuits.  The
tools available back then did not suit me; so I wrote a domain specific language,
APIC, on top of <a href="http://www.tcl.tk/">Tcl</a> and
<a href="http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/graphics/texdraw/">TeXdraw</a>.  I was somewhat
happy with the result: a Tcl program using some Tcl packages I wrote, taking as input
the description of the drawing and generating TeXdraw environments to be included in
LaTeX documents; documentation in Texinfo format.  At the time, I was a Tcl
enthusiast.  It was fun to write the <acronym>DSL</acronym>.
</p>
<p>I want to review those documents and put some of them on the Net.  The DSL is
bitrotten.  I have very little will to pick up again Tcl and APIC; but I have no
choice.  I wish I had written the thing as a C language library.
