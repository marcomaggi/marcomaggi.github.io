<p>Lately I have been thinking about what I could have learned in the years I made
myself busy with the Scheme language.  Recently, I have inflicted myself a hard slap
in the face (see <a data-manual="Stuff on life" href="../Stuff%20on%20life_html/Nov-06.html#Nov-06">(Stuff on life)weblog-2016</a>); it must have
changed the connections between my neurons, because it disrupted my routine way of
thinking<a class="footnote" id="DOCF1" href="#FOOT1"><sup>1</sup></a>; I realise now those
Scheme years have been dark years.
</p>
<p>As I have written before (see <a data-manual="Harbinger of
Failure" href="../Harbinger%20of%0aFailure_html/September-06.html#September-06">(Harbinger of
Failure)weblog-2015</a>), I tried some non&ndash;mainstream languages prior to landing in Scheme.  What
if I had stuck with C?  What if I had learned to program Arduino boards?  What if I
had focused on learning Programmable Logic Controllers?  (In high school, I was good
at programming <abbr class="acronym">PLC</abbr>s; going to university made me forget who I am&hellip; but
this is the subject for another post.)
</p>
<p>I want to put the development of my Scheme projects on hiatus; I will fix bugs if it
does not take much time, but no more active development.  For a while I want to
develop my C language skills; I want to refresh some things that I forgot how to do,
like multithreading.
</p>
<p>Then?  It has been a while since I tried a new language, but I am not sure that
learning a new programming language is a good idea.  There is this
<a class="url" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_learning">deep learning</a> thing I might want
to study a bit (I know nothing now).  Maybe other stuff.

<p>Maybe it made me start a midlife crisis.</p>
