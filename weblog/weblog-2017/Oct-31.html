<p><em>Posted on Tue Oct 31, 2017</em>
</p>

<p>Not the happiest time of the year.  USA&rsquo;s movies culture is slightly transforming
this time of the year, in Italy, into an occasion to party; but it is not meant to be
this way.  USA&rsquo;s culture can sod itself off.
</p>
<p>The italian tradition is to put your corpse in a tomb, although lately cremation is
gaining market share.  I do not really feel the need for a tomb.  Being a science and
technology enthusiast, I would like to definitively donate my whole cadaver for the
Advancement of Human Science (fuck yeah!); my carcass&rsquo; leftovers, if any, can be
cremated.
</p>
<p>As far as I can search the Net: for years and years there has been a proposal of law,
in Italy, to allow this practice in a clear and simple way; but the thing has not
been finalised yet.  It is still possible to do it, with a complex procedure offered
by some institutions, like the
<a href="http://www.dibinem.unibo.it/it/servizi-e-strutture/centro-per-la-donazione-del-corpo">University of Bologna</a>.  I would like a simpler method.
</p>
<p>A cremation urn is as inconvenient as a tomb.  It appears that some very ancient
populations used to keep the dried heads (the heads only) of their deceased relatives
on the floor of their house, maybe the kitchen; that makes it easy to talk to them,
no?  An urn is for sure less spooky but still a bit of impediment.  Getting rid of
the whole thing would be better.
</p>
<p>Now, I should have some <em>dolcetti</em> lying around&hellip;
