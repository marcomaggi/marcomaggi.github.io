<p><em class="emph">Posted on May 16, 2019</em>
</p>

<p>I had to comply with my learning idiosyncrasies, so I created a
<a class="url" href="https://github.com/marcomaggi/mmck-chicken-docs">new project</a> collecting unofficial
documentation for <small class="sc">CHICKEN</small> Scheme in <abbr class="acronym">gnu</abbr> Texinfo format; the first revision of the first
document, about <a class="url" href="http://marcomaggi.github.io/docs/chicken-internals.html"><small class="sc">CHICKEN</small> internals</a>,
is out as <small class="sc">HTML</small>.  The package includes a test suite to verify that the documented behaviours are
actually true with the ecosystem of <small class="sc">CHICKEN</small> components I have installed.
</p>
<p>The default <small class="sc">CHICKEN</small> documentation system, which revolves around the <code class="command">chicken-doc</code>
program, is frustrating me: it is too cumbersome for me, even with <abbr class="acronym">gnu</abbr> Emacs as pager (with all
its navigation and search facilities).
</p>
<p>In the last 30 years (in which I confronted some high&ndash;level learning tasks) I tried to follow the
learning patterns of other people, I really tried, but they just do not work; to actually learn
something, I always have to go back to my way: rewriting the material with a logic organisation,
visual appearance, navigation procedures that fit my neurological functions.  Otherwise I can do
nothing.
</p>
<p>So&hellip; that package is my learning infrastructure for <small class="sc">CHICKEN</small>&rsquo;s ecosystem.  Now that it
exists: I know where to place the bits I will learn today (maybe 5 minutes of work), and the bits I
will learn next week (maybe 8 minutes of work), and the bits I will learn at the end of the month
(maybe 2 minutes of work), and so on.  A handful of minutes here and there to grow a
<a class="url" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_model">mental model</a> of how things work.
</p>
<p>I envy a bit humans that do not have to hack their brain this way.  Life is hard!
