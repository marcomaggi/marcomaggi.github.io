<p><em class="emph">Posted on Oct 26, 2018</em>
</p>

<p>Yesterday I made a deep cleanup of my Net accounts; changed some passwords;
reorganised the paper copy of the accounts informations.  I really needed it.  There
was some old stuff that no longer exists, like an <em class="emph">Infogami</em> account
(<abbr class="acronym">rip</abbr>).
</p>
<p>Among the oldest accounts, there is a Sourceforge one.  I actually created two
accounts, a <a class="url" href="https://sourceforge.net/u/marcomaggi/profile/">very old one</a> in 2003
(of which I lost the credentials) and a
<a class="url" href="https://sourceforge.net/u/marcomaggi-ipsu/profile/">new one</a> in 2013.
Sourceforge always had an uglish interface in my eyes: the webpages do not guide my
eyes to the important informations.  This is still so.
</p>
<p>One of the things that troubled me was the impossibility of removing one&rsquo;s own
projects.  Well, it appears that now this is solved: yesterday I was able to delete
all my projects under the newest account.  It is now clean!
</p>
<p>So now, I am considering to restart using it for something.  As a backup of some
stuff I keep at Github.  It would be perfect if I could join the two accounts into a
single one&hellip;
