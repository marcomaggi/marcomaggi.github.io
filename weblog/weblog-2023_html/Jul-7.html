<p><em class="emph">Posted on Jul  7, 2023</em>
</p>

<p>The more art I like, the better my life is.  There is no advantage for me in not liking some
artistic expressions; when I was in my early twenties I put away all the identity searching that was
filtering out some art works.
</p>
<p>I like what I like, and it is fine for me to have eclectic tendencies: I do not feel my identity
diminished because of this.
</p>
<p>I search for new music on YouTube; that&rsquo;s my life; in my advanced age I want something new and
different.  I actually do consume music: I listen to the stuff I like, again and again, until my
brain cannot take it anymore.  Then I put those videos in a playlist and move on, searching for
other stuff.
</p>
<p>It is somewhat harsh, but: if a singer or band performs one or two songs that I like, in their whole
production, I consider it a success.  Most of the performers offer music that I do not like enough
to come back and listen to again.
</p>
<p>For some time in the past I liked some
<a class="url" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCgYqDQHmeM1ZIt7rYVdflVA">Alice Phoebe Lou</a>&rsquo;s and
<a class="url" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC6v3zljSKKxioPywlGXs3-Q">PJ Harvey</a>&rsquo;s songs.  But lately I do
not; it is a net loss for me.
</p>
<p>PJ Harvey&rsquo;s current production seems &ldquo;small&rdquo; to me.  She is more mature and maybe she has lost
some good weirdness.  Yes, I am a bad person!
</p>
<p>About Alice Phoebe Lou: I just do not share her choice of direction for her production; her songs
give me a 1960s vibe that I really do not like.  Gone are the times of <em class="emph">Berlin Blues</em> and
<em class="emph">Edge of the World</em>.  Damn!
</p>
<p>Anyway, in memory of old times, here is a video.
