<p>In psychology there is this idea that models of attachment defined in the early days, and
not&ndash;so&ndash;early days, of life will shape our default model of relationships in young and adult
existence; some unfortunate souls develop a toxic model of attachment; these puny humans have to
actively work on their brains to escape that model and build a healthier life.
</p>
<p>I have been aware of this theory for a long time, since before the Internet.  I thought that it is
just so dumb to fall into this trap; with some rational thinking we can easily escape, if we are
intelligent.  And I am intelligent!
</p>
<p>While going through midlife crisis and in the aftermath of it, I have built a model of myself in
which I am dumb like other people.  One could say that these are just words: in our mind we can
build an abstract interpretation of a concrete life scenario and we can just layer abstract
interpretation on top of abstract interpretation and we go wherever we want.
</p>
<p>I have to give a bit of credit to myself: back when I was lost in the horrors of love, my mind was
split in two; I literally thought of it in these terms.  On one side there was love, on the other
side there was rationality: what about this?, what about that?, what about this behaviour of hers
that is the opposite of what I want and need?  I was heavily, heavily conflicted; but it was not
really a debate: on one side reasoning, on the other side granitic obsession.
</p>
<p>It also happened only once: I did not live the same pattern again and again.
</p>
<p>It was still devastating.
</p>
<p>At some point I developed the will to remove the whole situation; to erase love with an act of
force; it did not work; I failed to transform myself into a narcissistic cyborg, which is what I
should have done to move on with life, improve my chances to achieve results, enjoy life and so on.
I went on uselessly trying to remove this pressure from my brain.
</p>
<p>Now I&rsquo;m in the &ldquo;after&rdquo;.  Midlife crisis really worked!  Ha!  Ha!  The pressure is gone!  I cannot
really say, obviously, but I like to think of it as if new neural pathways have formed in my brain
and now I can think thoughts that were not possible before.
</p>
<p>I do not love her anymore.
</p>
<p>I am left with the consciousness all the human resources I have wasted; I feel guilty in front of
myself for losing the battle for so long.
</p>
<p>Batman loves Catwoman, what about that?  It is a toxic love; Batman loses this battle again and
again.
</p>
<p>Can I forgive myself for losing mine?
</p>
<p>Am I this banal?
