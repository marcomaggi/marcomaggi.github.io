<h2 class="unnumbered" id="Compiler-review_2026-damn_0021-_00282015-March-06_0029">Compiler review&hellip; damn! (2015 March 06)</h2>


<p>I have merged the <a class="url" href="https://github.com/marcomaggi/vicare/tree/master">master</a> branch of <a class="url" href="http://marcomaggi.github.io/vicare.html">Vicare</a> into the branch
<a class="url" href="https://github.com/marcomaggi/vicare/tree/wip-compiler-review.marcomaggi-2014-07-14"><code class="code">wip-compiler-review</code></a>, which is a work&ndash;in&ndash;progress review of the compiler.
This merge was somewhat a fight: the code had diverged here and there and many things
about the changes in <code class="code">wip-compiler-review</code> have gone out of my mind.  I should
whip myself into being more organised in the way use branches.
</p>
<p>Anyway, I should be somewhat happy of the work I have done on this branch: the code
is better understandable, there is a lot more documentation&ndash;in&ndash;comments, the
generated code is a bit better (nothing extraordinary, only a bit better).  The thing
is: the compiler is detectably slower, even on my Intel Core i5; building the boot
image takes unbearably more time.  I hate this.
</p>
<p>There are three blocks of code that especially slow down boot image building:
</p>
<ol class="enumerate">
<li> The greatly expanded
<a class="url" href="https://github.com/marcomaggi/vicare/blob/wip-compiler-review.marcomaggi-2014-07-14/scheme/ikarus.compiler.core-primitive-properties.sls">table of primitives</a> used to: validate the number of arguments to which core
primitives are applied; replace safe primitives with unsafe primitives when the
arguments have the correct type.

</li><li> The compiler library, which was already big before and now it is bigger.

</li><li> The expander library, which was already big before I started reorganising it and
implementing the tagged language, and now it is bigger.
</li></ol>

<p>The compiler does a bit more, there a couple more passes, but, I guess, the true
thing is that the compiler&rsquo;s code does not scale well with the size of the source
code.  The situation is so bad that I do not want to merge back
<code class="code">wip-compiler-review</code> into <code class="code">master</code>.  I will have to do some code analysis and
change some data representations; I will do it in one of the possible futures.
