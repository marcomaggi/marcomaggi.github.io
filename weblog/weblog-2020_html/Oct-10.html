<p><em class="emph">Posted on Oct 10, 2020</em>
</p>

<p>I have resisted for a long time before buying a smartphone, for various reasons; then I was forced
to get one because of home banking services requiring it.  Using the thing <strong class="strong">is</strong> changing my
brain (even though I am using it for non&ndash;social reasons); I have mixed feelings about this.
</p>
<p>Overall I am unsatisfied by the available applications ecosystem and market; but there is little I
can do.
</p>
<p>I like gadgets, but not if they are in control: I want to be in control!  Decades ago I was in love
with my HP48 scientific calculator (yes, yes, I know&hellip;).  And if I could rule over <em class="emph">the
right smartphone for me</em>, I feel I could renew that kind of relationship.
</p>
<p>The thing I have today behaves like a narcissistic female: it uses me; it gossips about me; it asks
third parties to spy on me; it betrays my trust.  How could I be happy?
</p>
<p>While zapping on <a class="url" href="https://www.youtube.com/c/PINE64inc/featured">YouTube</a>, I have found the
interesting <a class="url" href="https://pine64.com/product-category/pinephone/">PinePhone project</a>.  I want one!  I
do not know if it will ever reach production status, but it is the smartphone I want: totally open
and programmable.  See <a data-manual="weblog-2015" href="../weblog-2015_html/September-06.html#September-06">Harbingers of failure</a> in <cite class="cite">Marco&rsquo;s 2015 Weblog</cite>.
</p>
<p>The only problem with the PinePhone is that I really need the home banking applications (from now on
<abbr class="acronym">hba</abbr>); there is no way the producers of such software will support a fringe device.  But is
that required?  I asked myself what is really required from a smartphone to provide the
authentication services that a <abbr class="acronym">hba</abbr> needs.
</p>
<p>From now on I will switch to wishful thinking.
</p>
<p>I am no expert, but, from what I see, I guess that there are &ldquo;applications&rdquo; that are not really
applications: they launch the web browsing engine and connect to a website, in a way that is not
very different from what we do with a proper web browser such as Mozilla Firefox; the only
difference is that the web browsing experience is embedded in what looks like an independent
application.
</p>
<p>If this is the case: it should be possible to provide device authentication by &ldquo;simply&rdquo; generating
a <abbr class="acronym">tls</abbr> certificate for the device and website using the device&rsquo;s own unique identifier (in
practice: a unique secret number assigned to the device by the manufacturer).  The device acts like
a <a class="url" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Certificate_authority">certificate authority</a> and it signs the
certificate you generate to access a specific service, that is a specific home banking service.  If
you have 3 banking accounts: 3 certificates are generated.
</p>
<p>If this technology works: there is no reason for an <abbr class="acronym">hba</abbr> to require a true application, it
can just rely on a specific website that allows connections from customers only if the customer uses
a &ldquo;registered device&rdquo;, which is a device on which a properly generated <abbr class="acronym">tls</abbr> certificate
has been installed.
</p>
<p>Problem solved for the PinePhone.  Ha! Ha! Ha!
</p>
<p>But life is hard&hellip;
