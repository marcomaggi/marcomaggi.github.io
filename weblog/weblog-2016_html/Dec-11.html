<p>I have been thinking these last days why I code.  I like it, that is for sure; but it
is not the whole story.  I have started many years ago to code, sometimes, to avoid
thinking; when I am focused I do not think to other things.
</p>
<p>Am I coding too much now?  Has this become a sodding dependence like drinking for
alcoholics?
</p>
<p>I should code less.  Do other things.  I like engineering, I studied
<a class="url" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_engineering">electrical engineering</a>
(<a class="url" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_engineering">power engineering</a> branch) and
I still like it (no matter how much they tried to make me hate it at university, and
they tried it hard).  But there was a time when I was curious about everything
&ldquo;complex&rdquo;.
</p>
<p>When I was a teenager I thought sometimes about learning how to repair mechanical
clocks.  Not really an easy thing to do by yourself.  At the beginning of the
nineties, some soviet watches were sold in Italy; they did not cost much (they are
more expensive today) and I bought
<a class="url" href="https://www.russian-watches.info/shop/russian-vintage-watches/soviet-mechanical-pocket-watch-molnija-wolfs-hunting-ussr/">one</a> with wolves on the back.  I loved it so much!  It was so satisfying to charge it
before going out in the morning!  And I broke it&hellip; I still have it, but it
cannot be repaired, they told me at a shop.  Damn!  Anyway, this is out of my reach.
</p>
<p>Back on track&hellip;  I will figure something out.
