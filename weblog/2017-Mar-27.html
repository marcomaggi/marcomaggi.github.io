<p><em>Posted on Mon Mar 27, 2017</em>
</p>

<p>Back when I was around 13yo I started learning to play the guitar, for the very
intelligent reason of impressing a girl who was somewhat good at singing (end of
story: it did not work out).
</p>
<p>I started with a course for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_guitar">classical guitar</a>: I did not like it very much, but the teacher taught me the basic
technique.  Around three years later I bought an
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steel-string_acoustic_guitar">acoustic guitar</a>,
which should have been my first choice.  But I knew nothing about acoustic guitars
and I made the mistake of buying a 12-strings one (12-strings are gorgeous!), which
is very difficult to tune and play, especially if you are a beginner.  I had cramps
in my left hand; steel strings cut my skin repeatedly&hellip;
</p>
<p>In the error I was lucky: 12-strings guitars have a wider keyboard, which means that
if you mount only the 6 standard strings, they are more spaced and will forgive you
if your finger placement is imperfect.  I liked this setup.  So I was alternating:
some time with 12 strings and some time with 6 strings.
</p>
<p>For a while I was motivated: I exercised regularly, self&ndash;taught songs and arpeggios,
wrote my own songs book with a collection of guitar tabs (partly by hand and partly
on an old typewriter, which is where I learned to type).  I was playing especially
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/VascoRossiVEVO">Vasco Rossi</a>,
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/degregoriVEVO">Francesco De Gregori</a>, <em>Edie
Brickell and the New Bohemians</em>, and some other italian and non&ndash;italian songs.
</p>
<p>I learned things: playing music is fun; even if you are not a master guitarist (I
have never been more than a past-beginner level), the guitar can give you real
satisfaction; I have no artistic creativity whatsoever, there is no way I can compose
music myself.
</p>
<p>In the past 15 years I seldom played something.  My non&ndash;prestigious guitar is
exhausted: it has deformed wood, it does not keep tuning, it does not play well
anymore.
</p>
<p>Enough of me.
</p>
<p>I have a niece.  I would really like to introduce her to music&ndash;playing.  It is a
quite hard thing to do: to get a kid interested in something.
</p>
<p>For reasons, she cannot play the guitar.  Keyboards and piano are problematic, but
possible for a person with a bit of maturity and determination, but she is 7yo
now&hellip; will see.  So what simple instrument can I propose to her?
</p>
<p>There is beatboxing!!!  Now, there are some awesome girls like

</div>
<p>in one of the possible futures I will let my niece know that beatboxing exists; but
not today&hellip;
</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diatonic_harmonica">Diatonic</a>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richter-tuned_harmonica">harmonica</a> would be
ideal: it is a small instrument; you can play it everywhere; you can play nice
melodies, especially Blues; in my opinion, it is a somewhat <em>intuitive</em>
instrument.  Female Blues harmonica players are a rare sight, but
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/paulandannie">they</a>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/indiharp">do</a>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCQZB8_Z8ufNW0csQBVUYcVg">exist</a>:

</div>
<p>my niece already knows about harmonica because I&rsquo;ve let her make noise with my own
one.  This is for sure an option.
</p>
<p>What about drums?  It would be amazing:

</div>
<p>I can buy her a pair of sticks and try to have her make noise by hitting a tablet of
Pongo.  But then?  Nobody in the family plays drums.
</p>
<p>Back on planet Earth.
</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocarina">Ocarina</a> is a relatively easy one; a bit
boring, maybe?  Anyway there would be problems&hellip;
</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melodica">Pianica</a> is&hellip; difficult?  Easy?
Kids can play it:

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kazoo">Kazoo</a>!  Not really an instrument, but
funny!  Nice gift, but not satisfactory.
</p>
<p>Ah&hellip; the hard life of uncles&hellip;
