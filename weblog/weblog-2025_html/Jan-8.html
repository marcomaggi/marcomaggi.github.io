<p><em class="emph">Posted on Jan  8, 2025</em>
</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m reassessing my choices in my C language library to handle exceptions; at my age I still have not
found the definitive way to do it, with the right mechanism and the right names as identifiers; I
suck at software engineering.
</p>
<p>Many years ago I read cover&ndash;to&ndash;cover the book:
</p>
<blockquote class="quotation">
<p>Alan Burns, Andy Wellings.  &ldquo;Real&ndash;Time Systems and Programming Languages&rdquo;.  Details forgotten,
but probably second edition.
</p></blockquote>

<p>it was a mistake to spend so much time on that; but I did it nevertheless.  (I mean&hellip; I read
cover&ndash;to&ndash;cover the manual of the HP 48 handheld calculator; so what!?)
</p>
<p>The one thing that stuck in my head is an abstract model for exceptions that the book helped me
assemble; I do not know if the authors would approve it; right or wrong does not even matter: it is
the only model that stuck in my head.  It goes like this:
</p><ol class="enumerate">
<li> there are only two kinds of exceptions: <em class="emph">logic</em> and <em class="emph">runtime</em>;

</li><li> logic exceptions do not happen in error&ndash;free software running on error&ndash;free hardware when no
cosmic rays flip bits at random;

<ul class="itemize mark-bullet">
<li>liveness is important: it is better if non&ndash;simple software is resilient to logic errors;
</li></ul>

</li><li> everything else is a runtime exception;

<ul class="itemize mark-bullet">
<li>it is always possible to build an abstract model in which a runtime exception is a synchronisation
error:

<ol class="enumerate" type="a" start="1">
<li> two processes have a <em class="emph">rendez&ndash;vous</em> in time with the purpose of establishing a common value for
a state; in some situations the new desired state is selected by one of the processes;

</li><li> if the <em class="emph">rendez&ndash;vous</em> is terminated successfully: life is good, every process moves on with the
same information about the state;

</li><li> otherwise an error happened; let&rsquo;s try something else;
</li></ol>

</li><li>there is nothing a process can do to make it impossible for runtime exceptions to happen.
</li></ul>
</li></ol>

<p>Simple example (it looks simple, it has hell inside): a process calls the standard C language
function <code class="code">malloc()</code>, there is a <em class="emph">rendez&ndash;vous</em> between the process and the memory allocator
implemented by the operating system.
</p>
<p>I need to keep my ideas in good order; otherwise I can do nothing.  I would really like to write
code in which this abstract model is recognisable.  It is simple to organise a tree hierarchy of
exceptional&ndash;condition objects having 2 main branches: the logic errors; the runtime exceptions.  It
is hard to effectively implement the <em class="emph">rendez&ndash;vous</em> idea without making the code too heavy to
write; I never really succeeded.
</p>
<p>The closest I got, in my opinion, was when I used Scheme syntaxes to attempt an implementation of
the &ldquo;compensations&rdquo; mechanism described in section 7 of:
</p>
<blockquote class="quotation">
<p>Westley Weimer, George C. Necula.  &ldquo;Finding and Preventing Run&ndash;Time Error Handling Mistakes&rdquo;.  In
Proceedings of the <abbr class="acronym">ACM</abbr> Conference on Object&ndash;Oriented Programming, Systems, Languages, and
Applications, 2004.
</p></blockquote>

<p>under Scheme languages we can do it on top of the <code class="code">with-exception-handler</code>,
<code class="code">dynamic-wind</code> and <code class="code">lambda</code> syntaxes.  The short version of it is:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example-preformatted">(with-compensations
  (do-something)
  (compensate
      (open-this-thing)
    (with
      (close-this-thing)))
  (do-something-else))
</pre></div>

<p>it is hard to do it in non&ndash;Lispy languages.
</p>
<p>One thing I want to add is the idea of exception handler function that is called by <code class="code">raise</code>
without rolling back the stack; only if the exception handler fails to handle, the stack is unwound.
This also comes from Scheme.
</p>
<p>What I&rsquo;m doing now is procrastinating day after day, because I do not know; what does &ldquo;good
enough&rdquo; actually mean?
