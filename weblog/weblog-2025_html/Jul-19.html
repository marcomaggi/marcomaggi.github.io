</p>

<p>With the advent of pseudo&ndash;intelligences some people revamped the debate about what it means to be a
sentient being, and if there is a soul trapped inside the hardware+software systems that run the
pseudo&ndash;intelligences.
</p>
<p>I have no enthusiasm for these lucubrations.  I see no point in being anything other than agnostic,
in this regard.
</p>
<p>I do not believe in souls.
</p>
<p>I had a Christian education, so it irritates me a little, but, rationally, I have no problems
admitting that a sufficiently complex hardware+software system can mimic and even surpass the
functionalities of a brain generated by an organism based on deoxyribonucleic acid (<abbr class="acronym">DNA</abbr>).
Pseudo&ndash;intelligences of today can be connected to external mechanical actuators in such a way that
they have more functionalities than a mosquito, which has such a tiny brain&hellip;
</p>
<p>To me: life is only that generated by <abbr class="acronym">DNA</abbr>.  I do not care about understanding if
hardware+software systems have feelings, or are alive in any sense, or are sentient in any sense.
I&rsquo;m also agnostic about establishing a clear frontier between &ldquo;living beings&rdquo; and &ldquo;chemical
mechanisms&rdquo; that resemble living beings.  Pseudo&ndash;intelligences have no right to be treated as
living beings.
</p>
<p>One could very well state that an anti&ndash;human landmine has self preservation: it does not blow up by
itself.  Also, in a field of landmines: the first one that is stomped on, blows up, saving the lives
of the other landmines; what a display of altruism!
</p>
<p>There is one thing that troubles me about pseudo&ndash;intelligences: they could allow rich and powerful
people to not need other people anymore.
</p>
<p>Over the course of human history: given a population of <em class="math">N</em> individuals, how many individuals
were needed to keep the <em class="math">N</em> under an authoritarian rule?  You needed a number <em class="math">M &lt; N</em>; but
how big is <em class="math">M</em>?  What if the <em class="math">M</em> have wood sticks?  What if the <em class="math">M</em> have swords?
What if the <em class="math">M</em> have rifles?  What if the <em class="math">M</em> have cannons?  What if the <em class="math">M</em> have
pseudo&ndash;intelligent flying robots?
