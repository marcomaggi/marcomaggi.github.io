<p>This is part 2 of what I wrote yesterday, <a class="ref" href="Jul-19.html">Stuff on being sentient</a>.  I want to expand
about what it means for authoritarian rulers to have pseudo&ndash;intelligences at their disposal.
</p>
<p>It is fair to look at mafia organisations as a reiteration of feudalism; they control a territory,
they have hierarchy, they rule a portion of the economy and a portion of the life of people like
authoritarian governments.
</p>
<p>It is known to Italian citizens that: for quite a while the
<a class="url" href="https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosa_nostra">cosa nostra</a> boss Matteo Messina Denaro, a top
person in the list of criminals wanted by the Police, lived and fucked women, with no problems,
close to the town where he was born.  Nobody reported this to the Police.  Humans in the local
community were scared.  The community of <em class="math">N</em> humans was under the rule of <em class="math">M &lt; N</em> humans
with the means to use violence.
</p>
<p>Mafia organisations have a lot of money.  Whenever robots embedding Nvidia&rsquo;s personal computers
implementing pseudo&ndash;intelligence will become available, the mafia will be able to afford them.  Why
send a hitman, when you can send a robot?
