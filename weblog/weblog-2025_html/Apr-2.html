</p>

<p>I know nothing about geopolitics; why should I write about this stuff?  But I cannot help it.
</p>
<p>I live in Italy; I cannot remember to have ever purchased something <em class="emph">Made in the
<a class="url" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonwealth_of_Independent_States">Commonwealth of Independent
States</a></em>.  More or less, the <abbr class="acronym">cis</abbr> was supposed to be, for the peoples of the
ex-<abbr class="acronym">ussr</abbr>, what the European Union was for the peoples of Western Europe; it was meant to
push economies development and betterment of living standards; one could say that it was meant to be
the continuation of Russia&rsquo;s empire, but that is, in some way, the same; without development empires
crumble.
</p>
<p>So what did the <abbr class="acronym">cis</abbr> do for its peoples?  What was it able to create?  What is new, not an
inheritance from the <abbr class="acronym">ussr</abbr>?  (I mean: not the space program; that was created by the
<abbr class="acronym">ussr</abbr>.)
</p>
<p>One could say that: if in the past those peoples lived no big improvement of living standards, it is
because there was communism.  But communism has been gone for awhile now.  Did the peoples improve
their lives because of trading with Russia, or because of trading with western nations?
</p>
<p>Are Russians starting to realise that it is not someone else&rsquo;s fault?  And they react by doing the
only thing they can do to escape reality, which is: destroy something?
