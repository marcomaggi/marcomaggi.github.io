<p><strong class="strong">PREAMBLE</strong> I&rsquo;m a common citizen of the <em class="emph">EU.Italy</em>.  I have no economic power.  I have no
political power.  I write this stuff as an exercise in free speech.  If I were a Chinese person: I
could start <a class="url" href="https://duckduckgo.com/?t=ffab&amp;q=chinese+dissidents+around+the+world&amp;ia=web">getting phone calls (or worse) from Chinese officials</a> telling me to start meditating about my
future.  I do not want to live like that.  Would you?
</p></blockquote>

<p>I <strong class="strong">have</strong> to dump my shit again.  As I have written before: I see the geopolitical debate in
Italy as appalling.  I do not understand what some pundits have in their minds (in Italy: we do not
use the word &ldquo;pundit&rdquo; or any translation of it; maybe we should start doing it).  So I will
proceed to dump, in no particular order.
</p>
<div class="unnumberedsec-level-extent" id="About-_0060_0060respecting-people_0027_0027">
<h3 class="unnumberedsec"><span>About &ldquo;respecting people&rdquo;<a class="copiable-link" href="#About-_0060_0060respecting-people_0027_0027"> &para;</a></span></h3>

<p>Someone refers to the violation of the treaty between Russia and some western countries, about not
extending <abbr class="acronym">nato</abbr>, as &ldquo;disrespecting the Russian people&rdquo;.  It is entirely possible that
such treaty, formal or informal does not matter, has been violated.  Treaties get violated all the
time.
</p>
<p>But do not tell me that it was about &ldquo;respecting people&rdquo;: the treaty was about recognising some
countries as military powers with nuclear weapons, and so peoples in other countries, without
nuclear weapons, had to shut up and bend the knee.  What about respecting those other peoples?  Did
someone ask Poland, Ukraine, the Baltic States if they were fine with the treaty?
</p>
</div>
<div class="unnumberedsec-level-extent" id="About-_0060_0060barking-at-Russia_0027s-door_0027_0027">
<h3 class="unnumberedsec"><span>About &ldquo;barking at Russia&rsquo;s door&rdquo;<a class="copiable-link" href="#About-_0060_0060barking-at-Russia_0027s-door_0027_0027"> &para;</a></span></h3>

<p>According to some persons: extending <abbr class="acronym">nato</abbr> is a direct threat to the Russian people.  What
about Putin&rsquo;s repression of dissent and carnage in Chechnya (no matter who started it: both sides
were fine with committing atrocities)?  Do you want that in your country?  Who&rsquo;s barking at whom?
</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s not forget that on one side there&rsquo;s been <abbr class="acronym">nato</abbr> extension, but on the other side the
European Union offered Russia the opportunity of integrating economies and betterment of Russians&rsquo;
human life conditions.
</p>
<p>After the collapse of the Soviet Union: the Baltic States were in great difficulty; then (through
integration with the West, not integration with the
<a class="url" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonwealth_of_Independent_States">Commonwealth of Independent
Nations</a>) step by step they have progressed and built a better life for themselves.  This did not
happen in Russia, can you tell me why?
</p>

<h3 class="unnumberedsec"><span>About having nuclear weapons being bad<a class="copiable-link" href="#About-having-nuclear-weapons-being-bad"> &para;</a></span></h3>

<p>It sucks that there is nuclear bombs proliferation.  But there is.  I am a very bad person, so: I
would be fine with Italy having at least tactical nuclear bombs and thermobaric bombs.  I recently
heard some comments about &ldquo;having nuclear weapons meaning being part of the Platinum Club&rdquo; in the
geopolitical theatre; I agree.
</p>
<p>Another comment with which I agree: India and Pakistan would very much like to go to serious war
with each other; they do not do it because both of them have nuclear weapons.  The risk is too high.
Do these situations slowly suck the life out of humans?  Yes, they do.  Can we do something about
it?  No.  I mean&hellip; India is the homeland of Gandhi, the non-violence man; still India has
nuclear weapons.  It is what it is!
</p>

<h3 class="unnumberedsec"><span>About the European Union, and Italy specifically, not pushing for diplomacy<a class="copiable-link" href="#About-the-European-Union_002c-and-Italy-specifically_002c-not-pushing-for-diplomacy"> &para;</a></span></h3>

<p>Do we still have to hear this argument?  To me, it is an established historical fact that: if a
country is not a big military power, nobody will listen to it in diplomatic exchanges.  When an
italian political figure says something about stopping to kill humans, or something like that,
everybody ignores him/her.  It is not different than being the Pope of the Catholic Church:
everybody expects him to plead for peace; then everybody ignores him.  It is what it is!
</p>

<div class="unnumberedsec-level-extent" id="About-Putin-being-able-to-send-its-troops-West-to-Portugal">
<h3 class="unnumberedsec"><span>About Putin being able to send its troops West to Portugal<a class="copiable-link" href="#About-Putin-being-able-to-send-its-troops-West-to-Portugal"> &para;</a></span></h3>

<p>Someone says, again and again, that the European Union has no enemies; that there is no threat at
all.  Putin will not, and would not be able to, conquer Europe by invading it and sending troops
through until it reaches Portugal.  In my evil opinion: he does not have to.
</p>
<p>If he succeeds in replicating the Belarus model in Ukraine, Serbia, Hungary, the Baltic States: he
will push forward his political agenda of repression and economic influence.  There are politicians,
in Italy and elsewhere, that are ready to bend the knee in front of Putin; everybody knows!
</p>
<p>The administration of the United States of America did not bomb Western Europe after 1950, still:
European governments obeyed it.  Current European heads of government still obey the USA.  If the
USA step back from <abbr class="acronym">nato</abbr>: who will the European heads of government have to obey?
</p>
<p>I still remember, years ago, an episode in which the Chinese ambassador in Italy expressed concern
because: Italian authorities were not fine with the conditions of labour in some textile districts
with strong Chinese presence.  As if, according to the ambassador: it was not up to the Italians to
enforce rules about rights and safety on the Italian territory.  The Italian government was
embarrassed, because it is dangerous to contradict China.  It is what it is!

<h3 class="unnumberedsec"><span>About predicting the future<a class="copiable-link" href="#About-predicting-the-future"> &para;</a></span></h3>

<p>I have already written that it is not possible to predict the future; nobody has The Truth in
his/her pockets.  In the history of mankind: both good choices and bad choices have been made in
Geopolitics.
</p>
<p>Causing the death of many humans looks like a &ldquo;bad choice&rdquo;; but still some humans are fine with
it.  Causing the economic destruction of countries looks like a &ldquo;bad choice&rdquo;; but still some
humans are fine with it.
</p>
<p>If you want to predict the future, what are you going to do?  Predict the real, future mixture of
good and bad choices heads of governments will make?  And you are confident you can do it?
