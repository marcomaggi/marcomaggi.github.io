</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been doing some cleanup; I need simplicity.
</p>
<p>My Bitbucket account is gone: I do not like the website; it appears that I am now able to put binary
release files on Github, which is something that caused me many troubles years ago, so I do not need
Bitbucket&rsquo;s project download areas anymore.
</p>
<p>My software is only on <a class="url" href="https://github.com/marcomaggi">Github</a>.  In one of the possible futures
I will update my profile image, which is getting pretty old; but not tomorrow (I have not changed
very much, but still&hellip;) (I&rsquo;m not photogenic) (someday I will give up and start wearing reading
glasses, this will transform me in the cool intellectual character from anime series: get ready
female mammals of planet Earth!).
</p>
<p>I have also deleted many software projects that I have no intention of touching anymore; it makes no
sense to keep them in public repositories (they are also easy targets for fake followers, which is a
thing for some reason I will never understand); I still have them in my triple backups at home, so I
can recycle some code if I need to.
</p>
<p>Some projects will undergo deep rewriting, renaming and branch chopping: I will remove them and
re&ndash;upload them when they are somewhat functioning.  I will try to focus on C11, <abbr class="acronym">gnu</abbr> Bash, maybe
something for <abbr class="acronym">gnu</abbr> Emacs.
</p>
<p>I will give some thinking to Scheme.  Lisp gives me something that no other language can; I have a
big code base under the Vicare project; I want more than Scheme; I want a strongly typed language; I
want a compiler that transforms Lispy code into C language code which can be compiled to native Unix
shared objects; I want a language implementation that does not require a PhD in Software Engineering
to be understood.  I do not know what to do.
</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been quite some time since I stopped informing myself about the latest trends in software
engineering; what are people on <em class="emph">Programming</em> and <em class="emph">Coding</em> Reddits talking about?  Phython
won; are functional languages on the retreat?  If I see too much AI stuff: I will puke, I cannot
take it anymore.  Anyway, the era of free Travis CI is over; my era of Github badges is over; I will
have to remove them all; it will take time.
</p>
<p>In the latest months I have developed a <a class="url" href="https://github.com/marcomaggi/mmux-bash-pointers">toy
project</a> which has spawned <a class="url" href="https://github.com/marcomaggi/mmux-cc-types">other</a>
<a class="url" href="https://github.com/marcomaggi/mmux-cc-libc">projects</a>.  I&rsquo;m close to tag the next development
releases and consequently upload the documentation on my website.
</p>
<p>At my age: there is plenty of stuff I do not care about anymore.  In software: I am tempted to
target only the <abbr class="acronym">gnu</abbr> platform, especially the <abbr class="acronym">gnu</abbr> Compiler Collection and the <abbr class="acronym">gnu</abbr> C Library;
why should I care about anything else?
