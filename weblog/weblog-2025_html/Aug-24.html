</p>

<p>A world of chatbots, that&rsquo;s what planet Earth is.  In itself, the fact that the word and the
technology of &ldquo;<a class="url" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chatbot">chatbots</a>&rdquo; exist is a testament to the
importance of chatting.
</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the subsystem dedicated to &ldquo;LightWeight Chatting for Entertainment Purposes&rdquo;
(<abbr class="acronym">lwcep</abbr>) is offline in my brain; it is not that I do not want to chatter, but that the
device does not respond to queries on the bus.  I get the interrupt requests
(<a class="url" href="https://docs.kernel.org/core-api/irq/concepts.html"><abbr class="acronym">irq</abbr></a>) that signal when I should
say something funny, but&hellip; nothing (<samp class="file">/dev/lwcep0</samp> on fire?).
</p>
<p>This pisses off a lot of people, especially female mammals.  The idea that common males can get
along without chatting is a lie.  Life is hard.
</p>
<p>External technology does not help me: I gather it would be impolite if, when I meet people, I grab
my smartphone and turn on a customised chatbot and let the people and the chatbot chatter away; I
could just nod and smile, every now and then, to signal that I am listening and I approve the
conversation that the chatbot is delivering; even though the experience would be better: people
would be disappointed.
</p>
<p>But what if I just nod and smile and say nothing?  More disappointment or less disappointment?
</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not always silent either: I can go on with informations and procedural descriptions.  Not
useful.
</p>
<p>When I was young I believed that with <em class="emph">TheRightMotivation</em>&copy; I could learn how to do
it algorithmically; I was wrong, and the frustration was deep.  Nowadays I try not to care anymore:
self&ndash;acceptance is the key to all the self&ndash;confidence nonsense.
