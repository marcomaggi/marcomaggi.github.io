<p><em class="emph">Posted on Sep 21, 2025</em>
</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been posting on this weblog about stuff I&rsquo;m not an expert about; I have been asking myself if
this is right (in general, not specifically about this weblog nobody reads).  I&rsquo;m inclined to
conclude that it is fine.
</p>
<p>Through the <em class="emph">Internet</em> I&rsquo;ve been exposed to ideas whose existence I was not aware of; it
happened while I was reading posts from people that just wanted to express their curiosity about
random topics; I&rsquo;m thankful for this.
</p>
<p>Ironically, here is one example that probably sounds stupid: I&rsquo;m fairly sure the first time my mind
was exposed to the sequence of words &ldquo;critical thinking&rdquo; was not in school, neither in family, nor
in church; it was while reading a comics strip created for fun by (if I remember correctly) a
scholar of Mathematics.
</p>
<p>Prior to that: I must not underestimate the role of the novel &ldquo;The World of Null-A&rdquo; by A. E. van
Vogt, of which I read an Italian edition in my preadolescence years (in future I would like to read
the original English edition).  It made me understand that I wanted to be a critical thinker, even
if I was not using those words to describe the concept.
</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m focusing on this because I want to split a portion of my Applied Mathematics project into a
subproject; it is not about a subject I am an expert on; the reverse is true: I always struggled to
understand what that is all about; in a way: given that I&rsquo;m an ignorant in that subject, I want to
make clear how I understand it, so that it will be easier to spot errors when I use it in the main
project.  Makes sense?
</p>
<p>Anyway, the subject of the subproject is: how to apply the axiomatic theory of probability to model
the uncertainty with which we estimate the happening of future events.  I gather I&rsquo;m not the only
one who struggles with this; so I suggest the following, which did not solve my doubts, it only
reinforced them.
