<p>I was inspired by the following interview to Roberto Saviano to dump some more of my shit; I find it
one of the best interviews to Saviano.

<p>Let&rsquo;s establish a framework for reasoning.  It is in the nature of humans to be rapacious against
other humans; there exist human societies in which: the conditions are such that there is an
emergence of some form of feudalism, because there is room for it; rapacious instincts find their
way in these forms of feudalism.  One could say that humans are tribal and feudalism is one of the
possible forms in which the violent part of tribalism coalesce.
</p>
<p>In this post, with <em class="dfn">feudalism</em> I mean: a hierarchy of power (mostly male humans) that uses
violence to control humans living in a territory, with the purpose of extracting resources; the
control is not directly over the land itself (nobody can control how many leaves a tree produces)
but over the humans that inhabit such region.  To have something to think about: with
<em class="dfn">resources</em> I mean money and females.
</p>
<p>If I say that <em class="dfn">there is room</em> for feudalism I mean that: what can common, non&ndash;violent, humans
really do to contrast the emergence of such powers?  Not much.
</p>
<p>I want this broad definition of feudalism because: I want to state that the Italian mafia, the
Ukrainian mafia, the Russian mafia, the Ukrainian neo&ndash;Nazi groups are all forms of this.  In Italy
we do have neo-Fascism, so I do not doubt that there can be neo&ndash;Nazism in Ukraine.
</p>
<p>I despise this form of feudalism; fortunately I am not the only one.
</p>
<p>It is a misfortune of the human condition that human people have a mentality such that feudalism
emerges.  In regions like Ukraine such mentality exists; it was crushed while the Soviet Union
existed, but it did not go away; after the collapse of the USSR it came back.  Is this a surprise?
It must not be.
</p>
<p>Can we do something to melt away this way of thinking?  Can we go to Italy, Ukraine or Russia and
melt away this way of thinking?  Will this way of thinking go away if we wage war to Italy, Ukraine
or Russia?  The answer to all of these questions is: it is unlikely.  Waging war to a human people
is the worst way of dealing with this: we want peace and human rights and we violate them all with
war.
</p>
<p>So we come to the question that prompted me into writing this post: from the point of view of
Putin&rsquo;s regime, what&rsquo;s the problem with Ukrainian Nazis?  Is it that Putin is against feudalism?  Is
it just propaganda?  Is it that from the point of view of young, violent, boys: Ukrainian
neo&ndash;Nazism&rsquo;s ideology is more attractive that Russian mafia&rsquo;s ideology?
</p>
<p>(I&rsquo;m not ignoring the Palestine situation: when we have established a framework for reasoning, you,
Dear Reader, can apply it as you see fit.)
