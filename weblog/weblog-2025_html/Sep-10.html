<p>Is <a class="url" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thatcherism"><em class="emph">Thatcherism</em></a> an absolute tactic to create
wealth for a people?
</p>
<p>All that follows is a speculation from myself: an ignorant in geopolitics and economy.
</p>
<p>We could say that:
</p>
<ol class="enumerate">
<li> <em class="emph">English Empire</em> created wealth for the English people while it was able to extract
<strong class="strong">commodities</strong> from its colonies.  Some of that wealth was distributed to the British peoples.

</li><li> That historical epoch ended.  <em class="emph">English Empire</em> started to decline, because, in itself, it is
unable to create significant wealth.

</li><li> <em class="emph">Thatcherism</em> allowed London&rsquo;s <em class="emph">Rich People of Finance</em> to accumulate significant wealth
by extracting from <em class="emph">Europe</em>, and other economies, the particular commodity <em class="emph">fees on
financial transactions</em>.  Some of that wealth was distributed to the British peoples.

</li><li> That historical epoch started to end.  <em class="emph">English Empire</em> started to decline, because, in itself,
it is unable to create significant wealth.

</li><li> As a consequence of that and some other contingencies: <em class="emph">Brexit</em> was executed, possibly under
the belief that there exist something we can call <em class="emph">English Exceptionalism</em>.

</li><li> <em class="emph">English Empire</em> continued to decline, because, in itself, it is unable to create significant
wealth.
</li></ol>

<p>Are members of <em class="emph">English Royal Family</em> aware that there is no such thing as <em class="emph">English
Exceptionalism</em>?  What about English politicians?  What about everybody else?
