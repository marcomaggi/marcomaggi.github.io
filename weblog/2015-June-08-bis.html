<h3 class="unnumberedsec">Projects review</h3>

<div align="center">Posted on June 8, 2015</div>

   <p>General projects cleanup at Github.  I have removed the projects: &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">r6rs-sofa</span></samp>&rsquo;,
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">r6rs-infix</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">r6rs-readline-wrappers</span></samp>&rsquo;; I do not have the energy to
maintain them anymore.

   <p>Anyway, more reviews of <a href="References.html#References">Vicare</a>'s extensions implementing interfaces to foreign
libraries.  Having formally abandoned Sourceforge and Gitorious, the code is on
<a href="https://github.com/marcomaggi/">Github</a> and
<a href="https://bitbucket.org/marcomaggi/">Bitbucket</a>.

<h4 class="unnumberedsubsec">Vicare/SOFA</h4>

<p>The International Astronomical Union's <a href="http://www.iausofa.org">SOFA</a> Collection
consists of two libraries of routines, one coded in Fortran 77 the other in ANSI C. 
There is a suite of vector/matrix routines and various utilities that underpin the
astronomy algorithms.

   <p>Back then, I repackaged the original distribution under the <acronym>GNU</acronym> Autotools; the
result is <a href="https://github.com/marcomaggi/atsofa">&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">atsofa</span></samp>&rsquo;</a>.  The work I did
for this package is a true madness: I am really not interested in Astronomy.  I had
some steam to release<small class="dots">...</small>

   <p>Vicare's code from &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">r6rs-sofa</span></samp>&rsquo; is now in a Vicare&ndash;only package:
<a href="http://github.com/marcomaggi/vicare-sofa/">Vicare/SOFA</a>.

<h4 class="unnumberedsubsec">Miscellaneous</h4>

<p>Once upon a time I started an extension: Vicare/Neon; it is an interface for the
<a href="http://www.webdav.org/neon/">Neon</a> C language library.  The last time I checked,
Neon was significantly underdocumented (according to my standards).  I never got
around to finish this package.  I have decided to drop it.  Work wasted.  That is
life.

   <p>I have a pretty decent (for me) interface to the
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/gsasl/"><acronym>GSASL</acronym></a> package:
<a href="https://github.com/marcomaggi/vicare-gsasl">Vicare/GSASL</a>.  <acronym>GSASL</acronym>
appears to be abandonware in search of new maintainers.  This saddens me, but there
is nothing I can do: I know almost nothing of crypto stuff, authentication and the
SASL mechanisms.  Right now <acronym>GSASL</acronym> does not even compile on my system.  It
annoys me to waste Vicare/GSASL: I want this package to exist.  I do not know what to
do.

   <p>I have a pretty decent (for me) interface to the
<a href="http://www.stafford.uklinux.net/libesmtp/">libESMTP</a> C language library:
<a href="https://github.com/marcomaggi/vicare-libesmtp">Vicare/libESMTP</a>.  This library
is, in practice, abandonware; but it works fine.  It depends on <acronym>GSASL</acronym>, so
while Vicare/GSASL is stalled, Vicare/libESMTP is stalled too.  Darn!

   <p>Back then, I started a package to interface OpenSSL:
<a href="https://github.com/marcomaggi/vicare-openssl">Vicare/OpenSSL</a>.  I have put some
significant effort in this package, but OpenSSL is so big that much more work is
needed.  Sooner or later I will come around and update this package to Vicare
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">0.4</span></samp>&rsquo;; then I will decide what to do.

   <p>The are a couple of packages for which I started a project, but never got around to
actually develop them: Vicare/GMIME, Vicare/Cairo.  I will have to do something about
them.

   <p><a href="https://github.com/marcomaggi/industria">Industria</a> is kicking me hard.  This
package has uncovered errors in Vicare: I have to whip myself into fixing them. 
But first I have to understand what is going on.  Anyway, I have updated the package
to Vicare &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">0.4</span></samp>&rsquo;.  The latest error happens when I compile the libraries
running <samp><span class="command">make</span></samp>:

<pre class="example">     *** Vicare: unhandled exception:
      Condition components:
        1. &amp;compiler-internal-error
        2. &amp;library: compiler
        3. &amp;module: assemble-sources
        4. &amp;who: xorl
        5. &amp;message: "invalid instruction operands"
        6. &amp;irritants: ((xorl 2264 %edi) 2264 %edi)
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">the Assembly instruction &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">xorl</span></samp>&rsquo; wants &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">%eax</span></samp>&rsquo; as second operand when the
first operand is a 32-bit constant; for some reason this constraints is not enforced
by the compiler, so &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">%edi</span></samp>&rsquo; is selected by the register allocator.  I will have
to research why.
