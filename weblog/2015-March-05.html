<h3 class="unnumberedsec">Overhauling the library infrastructure (2015 March 05)</h3>

<p>For <a href="References.html#References">Vicare</a> releases in the series <code>0.4</code> I have done a full overhauling of
the libraries infrastructure, along with code reorganisation.  I have been working on
this for some time and procrastinating the end of the restructuring for weeks; now I
have whipped myself into finalising at least some of it.  But there are still some
design decisions to be made, so more entries will follow on this subject.  This
section is about what's currently in the <a href="References.html#References">master</a> branch, <strong>not</strong> the latest
Vicare release.

   <p>Some of the changes are backwards <strong>in</strong>compatible.  Here is a quick list:

     <ul>
<li>Ikarus is no more; the library <code>(ikarus)</code> and the libraries in the hierarchy
<code>(ikarus system ---)</code> do not exist anymore.  The core library is now only
<code>(vicare)</code> and all the libraries are in the hierarchy <code>(vicare ---)</code>.

     <li>Library version numbers are supported; as far as I can tell, Vicare is one of the
very few (maybe the only) <acronym>R6RS</acronym> implementation that supports them.  If, while
scanning the file system search path, a library is loaded and its version numbers do
not match the requested version reference: that library is discarded and the search
goes on.

     <li>The library <code>(vicare)</code> has a version number, too; the full library name is:

     <pre class="example">          (vicare (0 4 <var>?year</var> <var>?month</var> <var>?day</var>))
</pre>
     <p class="noindent">where <var>?year</var>, <var>?month</var> and <var>?day</var> are fixnums representing the date of
the last build.

     <li>The default of the Vicare Scheme package (and in future of all the other Vicare
packages) is to install only the compiled library files and leave the source library
files not installed.  When running <code>make all</code> from the build directory of
Vicare packages: the Scheme libraries are compiled; the Makefiles will be written
in such a way to allow parallel builds; on my system with Intel Core i5 I do:

     <pre class="example">          $ make -j4 all &amp;&amp; make -j4 check
</pre>
     <p class="noindent">all the time, and it speeds up building significantly.

     <li>Previously there were 2 file extensions for <acronym>FASL</acronym> files to distinguish a 32-bit
build from a 64-bit build:

     <pre class="example">          .vicare-32bit-fasl
          .vicare-64bit-fasl
</pre>
     <p class="noindent">there is now a single <acronym>FASL</acronym> file extension: <code>.fasl</code>.

     <li>The packages configuration will arrange to install 32-bit <acronym>FASL</acronym> files under:

     <pre class="example">          $(prefix)/lib/vicare-scheme
</pre>
     <p class="noindent">and 64-bit <acronym>FASL</acronym> files under:

     <pre class="example">          $(prefix)/lib64/vicare-scheme
</pre>
     <li>The library <code>(vicare libraries)</code> exports an <acronym>API</acronym> to perform library&ndash;related
operations. 
</ul>

   <p>Now some topic discussion.

<!--  -->
<h4 class="unnumberedsubsec">No more caching of compiled libraries</h4>

<p>Since the days of the Ikarus code base, there has been support for caching compiled
libraries; other Scheme implementations have this feature (Guile, Mosh, Sagittarius,
Ypsilon).  It worked like this: we install source libraries in a system directory,
for example:

<div align="center"><samp><span class="file">/usr/local/lib/vicare/posix.sls</span></samp></div>

<p class="noindent">and import them as usual:

<pre class="lisp">     (import (prefix (vicare posix) px.))
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">the first time we import a library: Vicare loads the source file and stores a
compiled version in the cache directory, for example:

<div align="center"><samp><span class="file">~/.vicare/precompiled/usr/local/lib/vicare/posix.fasl</span></samp></div>

<p class="noindent">the second time we import a library Vicare loads the compiled file from the cache
directory.  Seems fine, but:

     <ul>
<li>If we uninstall a library: we have to remember to clean the cache directory.

     <li>If we load libraries from the build directory of a package while we are developing
them, the compiled files are stored in the cache directory.

     <li>We need to tell users that there exist a cache directory and explain how it works.

     <li>Every user on a Unix installation has its cache directory, unless we also have a
system&ndash;wide cache directory, which needs to be administered. 
</ul>

   <p>Back when I started getting the hang of preparing packages for Ikarus, I started
including a Makefile rule to precompile all the installed source libraries in the
cache; then I started to install both the source and binary files in system
directories, side by side.

   <p>I nuked all of this.  Starting with Vicare releases in the series <code>0.4</code>
caching of compiled libraries will not be supported anymore.  It is possible to
reintroduce it using the <acronym>API</acronym> exported by the library <code>(vicare libraries)</code>,
but Vicare does not offer it anymore.

<!--  -->
<h4 class="unnumberedsubsec">How library loading works now</h4>

<p>The library <code>(vicare libraries)</code> is defined by Vicare's boot image and
exports an <acronym>API</acronym> to allow the customisation of the library loading process.  Here is
an overview:

     <ol type=1 start=1>
<li>The <code>import</code> clause/syntax used in the source code instructs Vicare to
search a library whose <acronym>R6RS</acronym> name matches the given <acronym>R6RS</acronym> library reference.

     <li>To import a library we must first <em>intern</em> it.  Libraries are interned by the
function <code>find-library-by-reference</code>, which first searches the library in the
internal collection of already&ndash;interned libraries, then searches for a matching
library in some external repository.

     <li>If none of the libraries already interned matches the given reference:
<code>find-library-by-reference</code> makes use of the parameter
<code>current-library-loader</code>.  The function <code>default-library-loader</code> is the
default value of the parameter <code>current-library-loader</code>.

     <li>The function <code>default-library-loader</code> makes use of: the library locator
referenced by the parameter <code>current-library-locator</code>; the source library loader
referenced by the parameter <code>current-source-library-loader</code>; the binary library
loader referenced by the parameter <code>current-binary-library-loader</code>.

          <ul>
<li>The parameter <code>current-library-locator</code> is usually initialised to
one of the functions:

          <pre class="example">                   run-time-library-locator
               compile-time-library-locator
                     source-library-locator
</pre>
          <p class="noindent">either by default, or by direct selection with the command line option
<samp><span class="option">--library-locator</span></samp>.  The library locators search the file system for a
library file pathname matching a specified <acronym>R6RS</acronym> library reference.

          <li>The function <code>default-source-library-loader</code> is the default value for the
parameter <code>current-source-library-loader</code>.  Given a textual input port: it reads
from it a <code>library</code> symbolic expression; it verifies that its version
reference conforms to the library reference; using the expander procedure referenced
by <code>current-library-expander</code>: loads and interns all its dependency libraries;
expands it; compiles it; interns it.

          <li>The function <code>default-binary-library-loader</code> is the default value for the
parameter <code>current-binary-library-loader</code>.  Given a binary input port: it reads
from it a serialised library; verifies that its library name conforms to the library
reference; interns it along with all its dependency libraries. 
</ul>
     </ol>

   <p>Every parameter can be used to introduce some customisation in the process.  The
library locators need some discussion.

<!--  -->
<h4 class="unnumberedsubsec">Run&ndash;time library file locator</h4>

<p>The run&ndash;time library locator is the default; it can be selected explicitly with the
command line option <code>--library-locator run-time</code> or by setting the parameter
<code>current-library-locator</code> to <code>run-time-library-locator</code>; it is meant to be
used by an installation of Vicare to run applications.  The run&ndash;time locator
scans the search path for compiled libraries in search of a matching binary file; if
a matching compiled library is not found: it scans the search path for source
libraries in search of a matching source file.

   <p>The reference scenario for the run&ndash;time library locator is this:

     <ol type=1 start=1>
<li>We install the package Vicare Scheme, compiling bundled libraries and putting them in
some system directory; the libraries might be installed with pathnames like:

     <pre class="example">          /usr/local/lib/vicare-scheme/vicare/posix.fasl
</pre>
     <li>We install additional packages, compiling distributed libraries and putting them in
some system directory; the libraries might be installed with pathnames like:

     <pre class="example">          /usr/local/lib/vicare-scheme/vicare/something.fasl
</pre>
     <li>We configure the library binary search path to make sure that it includes the system
directory:

     <pre class="lisp">          (library-binary-search-path)
          &rArr; (... "/usr/local/lib/vicare-scheme" ...)
</pre>
     <li>We configure the library binary file scanner parameter:

     <pre class="lisp">          (current-library-binary-search-path-scanner
             default-library-binary-search-path-scanner)
</pre>
     <p class="noindent">which will scan the search path returned by <code>(library-binary-search-path)</code>.

     <li>We compose a Scheme program <samp><span class="file">demo.sps</span></samp> which imports the libraries:

     <pre class="lisp">          (import (vicare)
            (prefix (vicare posix) px.)
            (vicare something))
</pre>
     <p class="noindent">and we execute it selecting the run&ndash;time library locator:

     <pre class="example">          $ vicare --library-locator run-time --r6rs-script demo.sps
</pre>
     <p class="noindent">the command line option <samp><span class="option">--library-locator</span></samp> will put
<code>run-time-library-locator</code> in the parameter <code>current-library-locator</code>.  The
run&ndash;time locator is the default, so we can just do:

     <pre class="example">          $ vicare --r6rs-script demo.sps
</pre>
     </ol>

<!--  -->
<h4 class="unnumberedsubsec">Compile&ndash;time library file locator</h4>

<p>The compile&ndash;time library locator must be selected explicitly with the command line
option <code>--library-locator compile-time</code> or by setting the parameter
<code>current-library-locator</code> to <code>compile-time-library-locator</code>; it is meant to
be used from the build directory of a package while compiling libraries for
development or future installation.  The compile&ndash;time locator does the following:

     <ol type=1 start=1>
<li>Ask the file system search path scanner for the next library source file matching a
given library reference.

     <li>If a matching source library is found: look for an already compiled library file in
the <code>compiled-libraries-build-directory</code>:

          <ol type=a start=1>
<li>If no compiled file exists or it if exists but it is older than the source file:
accept the source file as matching.

          <li>If a compiled file exists and it is newer than the source file: accept the compiled
file as matching.

          <li>Return to the caller the matching file pathname.

          <li>If the caller rejects the binary file pathname: return to the caller the source file
pathname.

          <li>If the caller rejects the source file: loop to 1.
          </ol>

     <li>If no source file exists: loop to 1.
        </ol>

<p class="noindent">when using this locator we instruct the compiler to put compiled libraries in the
build directory.

   <p>The reference scenario for the compile&ndash;time library locator is this:

     <ol type=1 start=1>
<li>We install the package Vicare Scheme, compiling bundled libraries and
putting them in some system directory; the libraries might be installed
with pathnames like:

     <pre class="example">          /usr/local/lib/vicare-scheme/vicare/posix.fasl
</pre>
     <li>We install additional packages, compiling distributed libraries and
putting them in some system directory; the libraries might be installed
with pathnames like:

     <pre class="example">          <samp><span class="file">/usr/local/lib/vicare-scheme/vicare/something.fasl</span></samp>
</pre>
     <li>We unpack the distribution tarball of a package providing even more
libraries.  We have the source libraries under:

     <pre class="example">          $(srcdir)/lib/vicare/this.sls
          $(srcdir)/lib/vicare/that.sls
</pre>
     <p class="noindent">we want to compile them under the build directory:

     <pre class="example">          $(builddir)/lib/vicare/this.fasl
          $(builddir)/lib/vicare/that.fasl
</pre>
     <p class="noindent">and then install them in a system directory:

     <pre class="example">          /usr/local/lib/vicare-scheme/vicare/this.fasl
          /usr/local/lib/vicare-scheme/vicare/that.fasl
</pre>
     <p>This is the gist: in the package's building infrastructure (for example a Makefile
managed by the <acronym>GNU</acronym> Autotools) we need to write appropriate invocations of
<samp><span class="command">vicare</span></samp> to build the libraries locally and pick the appropriate source
libraries and compiled libraries.

     <li>It may be that the libraries in the source tree need to load installed libraries and
also have local dependencies:

     <pre class="lisp">          (library (vicare this)
            (export)
            (import (vicare)
              (vicare that))
            ---)
          
          (library (vicare that)
            (export)
            (import (vicare)
              (prefix (vicare posix) px.)
              (vicare something))
            ---)
</pre>
     <li>It may be that an older version of the package is already installed, so there already
exist installed binary libraries:

     <pre class="example">          /usr/local/lib/vicare-scheme/vicare/this.fasl
          /usr/local/lib/vicare-scheme/vicare/that.fasl
</pre>
     <p class="noindent">we want the libraries under <code>$(builddir)/lib</code> to take precedence over the
libraries under <samp><span class="file">/usr/local/lib/vicare-scheme</span></samp>.  It may be that there
exist installed source libraries:

     <pre class="example">          /usr/local/lib/vicare-scheme/vicare/this.sls
          /usr/local/lib/vicare-scheme/vicare/that.sls
</pre>
     <p class="noindent">we want the libraries under <code>$(srcdir)/lib</code> to take precedence over the
libraries under <samp><span class="file">/usr/local/lib/vicare-scheme</span></samp>.
        </ol>

   <p>At the Scheme level we want the following:

     <ul>
<li>Configure the library source search path to include only the local source directory:

     <pre class="lisp">          (library-source-search-path)
          &rArr; ("$(srcdir)/lib")
</pre>
     <li>Configure the library binary search path to include the system directory:

     <pre class="lisp">          (library-binary-search-path)
          &rArr; (... "/usr/local/lib/vicare-scheme" ...)
</pre>
     <li>Configure the build directory parameter to reference the local build directory:

     <pre class="lisp">          (compiled-libraries-build-directory)
          &rArr; "$(builddir)/lib
</pre>
     <li>Configure the library binary file scanner parameter:

     <pre class="lisp">          (current-library-binary-search-path-scanner
             default-library-binary-search-path-scanner)
</pre>
     <p class="noindent">which will scan the search path returned by <code>(library-binary-search-path)</code>.

     <li>Configure the library source file scanner parameter:

     <pre class="lisp">          (current-library-source-search-path-scanner
             default-library-source-search-path-scanner)
</pre>
     <p class="noindent">which will scan the search path returned by
<code>(library-source-search-path)</code>.

     <li>Configure the library locator parameter:

     <pre class="lisp">          (current-library-locator compile-time-library-locator)
</pre>
     <p class="noindent">which implements the appropriate policy. 
</ul>

   <p>Assuming Makefiles generated by <acronym>GNU</acronym> Automake: to achieve the desired result, we
have two options:

     <ol type=1 start=1>
<li>For every library to be compiled locally, we write in the Makefile an explicit
dependency rule:

     <pre class="example">          lib/vicare/that.fasl: lib/vicare/that.sls
                  VICARE_SOURCE_PATH=; export VICARE_SOURCE_PATH;    \
                  vicare --library-locator compile-time              \
                     --library-path    /usr/local/lib/vicare-scheme  \
                     --source-path     $(srcdir)/lib                 \
                     --build-directory $(builddir)/lib               \
                     -o $@ -c $&lt;
          
          lib/vicare/this.fasl: lib/vicare/this.sls lib/vicare/that.fasl
                  VICARE_SOURCE_PATH=; export VICARE_SOURCE_PATH;    \
                  vicare --library-locator compile-time              \
                     --library-path    /usr/local/lib/vicare-scheme  \
                     --source-path     $(srcdir)/lib                 \
                     --build-directory $(builddir)/lib               \
                     -o $@ -c $&lt;
</pre>
     <p class="noindent">this is the solution to prefer, because it allows parallel builds.

     <li>We write a script <samp><span class="file">compile-all.sps</span></samp> that imports at least the local libraries
that are leaves in the local package dependency tree:

     <pre class="lisp">          (import (only (vicare that))
                  (only (vicare this)))
</pre>
     <p class="noindent">we write a single Makefile rule that compiles in the build directory all the
dependencies of the script:

     <pre class="example">          .PHONY: vfasl
          
          vfasl:
                  VICARE_SOURCE_PATH=; export VICARE_SOURCE_PATH;    \
                  vicare --library-locator compile-time              \
                     --library-path    /usr/local/lib/vicare-scheme  \
                     --source-path     $(srcdir)/lib                 \
                     --build-directory $(builddir)/lib               \
                     --compile-dependencies compile-all.sps
</pre>
     </ol>

<h4 class="unnumberedsubsec">Source library file locator</h4>

<p>The source library locator must be selected explicitly with the command line option

<acronym>GNU</acronym> Autotools) we need to write appropriate invocations of <samp><span class="command">vicare</span></samp> to
build the libraries locally and pick the appropriate source libraries and compiled
libraries.

     <p>This is the gist: we want to automatically generate an include Makefile holding the
compilation and installation recipes correctly describing the dependencies among
libraries.  For this we need to load all the source libraries in the package's source
tree.

     <li>It may be that the libraries in the source tree need to load installed libraries and
also have local dependencies:

     <pre class="lisp">          (library (vicare this)
            (export)
            (import (vicare)
              (vicare that))
            ---)
          
          (library (vicare that)
            (export)
            (import (vicare)
              (prefix (vicare posix) px.)
              (vicare something))
            ---)
</pre>
     <li>It may be that an older version of the package is already installed, so there already
exist installed binary libraries:

     <pre class="example">          /usr/local/lib/vicare-scheme/vicare/this.fasl
          /usr/local/lib/vicare-scheme/vicare/that.fasl
</pre>
     <p class="noindent">we want these installed libraries to be ignored.  It may be that there exist
installed source libraries:

     <pre class="example">          /usr/local/lib/vicare-scheme/vicare/this.sls
          /usr/local/lib/vicare-scheme/vicare/that.sls
</pre>
     <p class="noindent">we want the libraries under <code>$(srcdir)/lib</code> to take precedence over the
libraries under <samp><span class="file">/usr/local/lib/vicare-scheme</span></samp>.
        </ol>

   <p>At the Scheme level we want the following:

     <ul>
<li>Configure the library source search path to include only the local source directory:

     <pre class="lisp">          (library-source-search-path)
          &rArr; ("$(srcdir)/lib")
</pre>
     <li>Configure the library binary search path to include the system directory:

     <pre class="lisp">          (library-binary-search-path)
          &rArr; (... "/usr/local/lib/vicare-scheme" ...)
</pre>
     <li>Configure the library binary file scanner parameter:

     <pre class="lisp">          (current-library-binary-search-path-scanner
              default-library-binary-search-path-scanner)
</pre>
     <p class="noindent">which will scan the search path returned by <code>(library-binary-search-path)</code>.

     <li>Configure the library source file scanner parameter:

     <pre class="lisp">          (current-library-source-search-path-scanner
              default-library-source-search-path-scanner)
</pre>
     <p class="noindent">which will scan the search path returned by <code>(library-source-search-path)</code>.

     <li>Configure the library locator parameter:

     <pre class="example">          (current-library-locator source-library-locator)
</pre>
     <p class="noindent">which implements the appropriate policy. 
</ul>

   <p>To achieve the desired result, in the Makefile we write rules as follows:

<pre class="example">     .PHONY: dependencies
     
     DEPSCRIPT = $(srcdir)/scripts/build-makefile-rules.sps
     
     dependencies:
             VICARE_SOURCE_PATH=; export VICARE_SOURCE_PATH; \
             vicare --library-locator source                 \
               --library-path /usr/local/lib/vicare-scheme   \
               --source-path  $(srcdir)/lib                  \
               --r6rs-script  $(DEPSCRIPT) --                \
               $(slsdir)/libraries.scm &gt;$(slsdir)/dependencies.make
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">where the executed Scheme script generates the Makefile rules automatically.  The
package Vicare Scheme comes with a script <samp><span class="file">build-makefile-rules.sps</span></samp> that does
exactly that to generate the dependencies among libraries; the extension packages
will use the same script with the same Makefile rule.

<h4 class="unnumberedsubsec">Native shared libraries?  Not easy</h4>

<p>The binary output from a compiler that I like most is the one produced by C
compilers: standalone binary programs, with libraries statically linked in; native
shared libraries whose loading, linking and sharing is performed by the Operative
System.  It would be awesome to have standalone binary programs and native shared
libraries in Vicare, but, alas, it is not possible; at least not without a major
overhauling of the internal architecture.

   <p>Machine code generated by Vicare is stored in proper Scheme objects: the <dfn>code
objects</dfn>; they are subject to garbage collection and are handled like all the other
objects; the only true difference is that they are allocated in memory pages with
execute permissions.

   <p>Code objects have a field referencing a vector, the <dfn>relocation vector</dfn>,
containing references to other Scheme objects used by the machine code (for example
constant Scheme objects hard&ndash;coded in the source); such references between objects
are built: at boot image load&ndash;time; at binary library load&ndash;time; at source library
compilation&ndash;time.  We can inspect the situation with the following code:

<pre class="lisp">     #!vicare
     (import (vicare)
       (vicare system $codes))
     
     (define V
       '#(1 2 3))
     
     (define (mutate)
       (vector-set! V 0 #\a))
     
     (define reloc-vector
       ($code-reloc-vector ($closure-code mutate)))
     
     (print-gensym #t)
     
     (write reloc-vector)
     (newline)
     
     (flush-output-port (current-output-port))
     -| #(470 43 #&lt;code&gt; 272 #{vector-set! |sVCU2mUD/G&amp;4T9&lt;T|} 48 #{V |j1$J&lt;JXhK2N2Kivt|})
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">we see that the last item in the relocation vector is a gensym with pretty name
<code>V</code>; this gensym holds the current value of the variable <code>V</code>, it is a
<dfn>location gensym</dfn> (or <dfn>loc gensym</dfn>) in Vicare's jargon.  The value stored
in this loc gensym is:

<pre class="example">     (write (symbol-value (vector-ref reloc-vector 6)))
     (newline)
     
     (flush-output-port (current-output-port))
     -| #(1 2 3)
</pre>
   <p>If code objects are just ordinary Scheme objects: it is easy to handle such mutable
references; code generated at run&ndash;time (by calling the core primitive <code>eval</code> or
other compiler primitives) is automatically handled in the correct way.  Putting
machine code with these mutable references in a native shared object and having it
interact transparently with other Scheme objects requires a significant change of
Vicare's run&ndash;time machinery.
