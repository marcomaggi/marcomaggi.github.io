<p>I do not play video games; pity me.  You could say: you are in your forties, that&rsquo;s
natural.  But then there&rsquo;s some
<a class="url" href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/sep/17/women-video-games-iab">evidence</a> that 40something are a significant slice of the video games market.
</p>
<p>I used to be a gamer in my teens.  For a time, in middle school I came home quickly
at midday to play a full run of <em class="emph">Bruce Lee</em> before lunch:

<p>this is one of the few games I was able to finish; it took me around 15 minutes if I
recall correctly (I actually kept a written record of my performance, and tried to
cut some seconds at every run).  I enjoyed a number of games on the C64:
<em class="emph">Ghostbusters</em>, <em class="emph">Bubble Bobble</em>, <em class="emph">Rainbow Island</em>, <em class="emph">Raid on
Bungeling Bay</em>, <em class="emph">Out Run</em> (with the
<a class="url" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qG82RMyS07Y">great music</a> by <em class="emph">Maniacs of
Noise</em>), some tennis variants.  Wait a minute&hellip; I have to wipe my tears&hellip;
</p>
<p>Then, towards 20yo, the appealing of gaming left me; I still played a bit, but the
magic was gone.
</p>
<p>Today there are very beautiful (and complex!) games.  It is different now, it
requires a level of commitment and constraining that I find annoying.
</p>
<p>It used to be that gaming took away your attention from the ugliness of life with
simple actions and very low intellectual activity (at least with the <em class="emph">shoot &rsquo;em
up</em> and <em class="emph">beat &rsquo;em up</em> kind of games).  Games being simple: they left <strong class="strong">a
lot</strong> to imagination, and this filled your kid mind.
</p>
<p>Now some games require you to build a full virtual identity, to engage in
interpersonal politics, to allocate tens of hours to play on until the end of the
&ldquo;movie&rdquo;; maybe I would have loved this as a teen, I dunno.  Some games have so many
sprites moving on the screen, that it is impossible to understand what is going on:
you just press the &ldquo;hit&rdquo; button frantically until the enemies are dead, in some
way.  But everything is already decided and graphically depicted: there is very
little to imagine.
</p>
<p>Lack of imagination exercising is one thing that strikes me.
</p>
<p>If I wanted to play now, I would resort to some basic games like
<a class="url" href="http://www.umutdervis.com/games/just_shut_up_and_drive_2.html">Shut Up and
Drive</a>, which is relaxing.  Or Tetris (the <abbr class="acronym">gnu</abbr> Emacs version), which I do not
like, but I have to admit it shuts off your thoughts for a while.  But it is very
very rare for me to have this desire.
</p>
<p>Good?  Bad?  Who knows&hellip;
