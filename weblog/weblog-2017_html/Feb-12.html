<p><em class="emph">Posted on Sun Feb 12, 2017</em>
</p>

<p>In the early nineties I was attending university in Milano.  Sometimes, at midday, I
needed to evade social pressure (and let a certain someone not waste her precious
time with my despicable self), so I used to leave the university neighbourhood for a
solitary lunch at a distant bar.
</p>
<p>Today it is called <a class="url" href="https://www.facebook.com/hemingwaycaf3/">Hemingway Caf&eacute;</a>,
it was Hemingway Bar back then, if I remember correctly.  It was a pleasant bar to my
eyes; the walls were covered with beautiful mirrors sporting advertising for
alcoholic beverages.  There was a lot to look at.  At noon the owners were there, an
oldish couple; the lady was always kind with this lonely customer.  I would eat some
small <em class="emph">panini</em>, simple but <a class="url" href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/oishii"><em class="emph">oishii</em></a>, and feel some relaxed sadness for awhile.
</p>
<p>There was a period in which, very often, they were playing an audio cassette:
<a class="url" href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLCUh2m4O_fcEVlB1M9-gv47K2c-LoCfdL">Top of
the Spot</a>.  I liked it so much that I bought that cassette myself.  One of the songs
I liked most was Sheryl Crow&rsquo;s <em class="emph">Run, Baby, Run</em>.  Every now and then this song
pops up in my mind and I remember the Hemingway Bar and the mirrors and the small
panini.  (And that certain someone obviously, because I am despicable&hellip;
remember.)  (And yes, it is the same some I have written about before.)
