<p>This is somewhat a followup to an old post, see <a class="url" href="../weblog-2015/September-06.html">Harbinger of Failure</a>.  There I detailed how I jumped from one programming language
to another in search for the one that satisfies me; finally, I somewhat settled on
Scheme.  Until recently.
</p>
<p>The main factor in excluding a language was: does this language allow me to organise
ideas the way I need, with abstractions that my brain can handle?  There&rsquo;s an
important missing piece in this reasoning: I also wanted to work on a programming
ecosystem that allowed me prove that I am smart.  If a programming environment is
already &ldquo;done&rdquo;, full of features developed by very smart people: it does not
attract me; because: what can I do?
</p>
<p>This is, probably, the true reason I do not like <a class="url" href="http://racket-lang.org/">Racket</a>: it is not only that some facilities do not fit my way of thinking, it is
also that everything is already &ldquo;done&rdquo; by people that are way smarter than me.
</p>
<p>In a way, this makes me ugly; I think I&rsquo;m smarter that the average and I want to show
it; if you do not show how cool you are: how do you seduce females?  But who do I
think I am?  Am I letting delusions dominate my life?
</p>
<p>On the other side: the desire of being smart drives you to have ambitions, to do and
create something that nobody else has.  This is something I want: to have original
ideas.  This is positive!  Or is it negative?  Rationally, I should not feel ashamed
by this desire; and why should I really &ldquo;settle down&rdquo; my desires in midlife?  But
what is the right measure?
</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m italian and I grew up in Italy; I&rsquo;ve been imbued with italian culture.  I feel
like an alien in this culture; I do not fit.  Italian culture does not reward
ambitions, it rewards fitting into the established power hierarchy; no matter what:
even if you have to shut up when someone says that 3 is less than 2.  You are allowed
to &ldquo;make it&rdquo; only if someone with power concedes it to you, otherwise you must not
make it.  This does not come natural to me, I do follow formal rules but I fail at
following the ever&ndash;changing informal rules that powerful people impose on their
subjects.
</p>
<p>This leads to a lot of frustration.  Hence the search for some way to satisfy my
ambitions.  And finally the quest for a programming ecosystem, a search I could do by
myself on the Net, without compromising with real people.
</p>
<p>Pathetic.
