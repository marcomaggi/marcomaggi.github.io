<h3 class="unnumberedsec">The inevitable pain of dealing with one's own mistakes</h3>

<div align="center">Posted on December 17, 2015</div>

   <p>Since the last post I pushed significant changes on the <a href="References.html#References">master</a> branch of
<a href="References.html#References">Vicare</a>.  I did a big clean&ndash;up of the expander, removing part of the code for
the typed language and replacing it with a new (better) implementation.  The old code
was ugly, but, with my currently better understanding of the expander, I think I got
it right: things are done as they should.  Obviously, the &ldquo;right way&rdquo; was already
there in the original Ikarus' expander code, but I was not able to recognise it as
such.

   <p>There are backwards incompatible changes between the current typed language
incarnation (which is still under development) and the old one.  Life is hard.

<h4 class="unnumberedsubsec">Missing command line options</h4>

<p>This Summer (see <a href="2015-July-02.html#g_t2015-July-02">2015 July 02</a>) I modified the interface to the garbage collector
to allow disabling GC and I implemented options to configure the heap and stack
sizes.  At some point I made some confusion (ugh!) and the associated command line
options disappeared from the code.  I have put them back: the command line options
<samp><span class="option">--scheme-heap-nursery-size</span></samp> and <samp><span class="option">--scheme-stack-size</span></samp> select the
sizes; the command line options <code>--option enable-automatic-gc</code> and
<code>--option disable-automatic-gc</code> enable and disable automatic garbage collection.

<!--  -->
<h4 class="unnumberedsubsec">Rotated boot images</h4>

<p>I have fixed the problems in the <code>master</code> branch that prevented rotating the
prebuilt boot images distributed with the tarballs; I have rotated the boot images,
so it is now possible to use the features in the source code to compile the boot
image itself.  I still have to do the same with the typed language
<a href="https://github.com/marcomaggi/vicare/tree/typed-language.marcomaggi-2015-11-18">branch</a>; things are more complicated in this branch for reasons I will discuss in
some future.

<!--  -->
<h4 class="unnumberedsubsec">Strict language and error reporting</h4>

<p>A Github user <a href="https://github.com/marcomaggi/vicare/issues/85">asked</a> for help in
interpreting an error message from Vicare.  I am completely sympathetic: the
condition objects are cryptic if one knows nothing of Vicare's internals and it is
quite difficult to determine the origin of the error in the source code.

   <p>In the original Ikarus code, the interpretation of
<a href="http://www.r6rs.org/final/html/r6rs/r6rs-Z-H-8.html#node_sec_5.4"><acronym>R6RS</acronym></a> is
that some errors must be raised at run&ndash;time and only if the code associated to the
offending form is evaluated.  This is the case of the &ldquo;wrong number of arguments&rdquo;
and &ldquo;wrong type of arguments&rdquo; in function application.

   <p>Vicare is changing this to detect as much as possible at expand&ndash;time and
compile&ndash;time; however it is not there, yet.  In particular, the core primitives
(defined by the boot image) have no syntax informations associated to them: in the
<code>master</code> branch's code base, there is nothing in the expander that allows checking
at expand&ndash;time a wrong number of arguments in applying, say, the core primitive
<code>substring</code>.  This is not so in the compiler, where I have already added a table
with arguments description for almost all the core primitives.

   <p>So it happens that the expander does not detect an error and the compiler does.  But
source code informations are present only in the expander, the compiler knows nothing
of source files; hence, when using code from the <code>master</code> branch, we see errors
stating that somewhere <code>substring</code> was applied to the wrong number of arguments. 
This is ugly.

   <p>The code in the typed language branch is starting to fix this problem by including a
table of core primitives in the expander, so that we can see a proper expand&ndash;time
error with source code informations.  It is still a work in progress.

   <p>When debugging this kind of errors, we can try to mitigate the problems by enabling
debugging mode and turning on &ldquo;strict <acronym>R6RS</acronym>&rdquo;; we do this by using <samp><span class="option">-g</span></samp> on
the command line and using the option &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">strict-r6rs</span></samp>&rsquo; in <code>program</code> and
<code>library</code> forms.  Strict <acronym>R6RS</acronym> mode disables reporting of some errors at
expand&ndash;time and compile&ndash;time, leaving them for run&ndash;time; this triggers the
debugger interface when an exception is raised and we can examine the stack trace to
gather some context on the location of the error.  It is not much, because the
debugger is still primitive<small class="dots">...</small>

<h4 class="unnumberedsubsec">Leaving Nausicaa behind</h4>

<p>The original Nausicaa libraries were intended to run on every <acronym>R6RS</acronym>
implementation, but at the end I introduced some Vicare&ndash;specific syntaxes
(especially the syntax <code>splice-first-expand</code>); the internals are quite clunky
and the source code expansion times are long.  I want the typed language from
<code>(vicare)</code> to be better than the Nausicaa language from <code>(nausicaa)</code>; it
want to make it possible to port all the code relaying on <code>(nausicaa)</code> to
<code>(vicare)</code> without loosing features.

   <p>In the end, Nausicaa will be removed from the package; the typed language branch
already has the Nausicaa libraries excluded from the build infrastructure.  Pain! 
Sorrow!  It hurts me to discard code (and documentation!) I have worked on for so
much time.  It also hurts me the to think of porting the code (and documentation!) to
a new language (not completely different, but different).  That is life<small class="dots">...</small>

   <p>I hope that nobody is heavily relying on Nausicaa out there (quite unlikely; anyway,
Vicare's major version number is zero for a reason).

<!--  -->
<h4 class="unnumberedsubsec">Prebuilt tarballs</h4>

<p>I started distributing tarballs at
<a href="https://bitbucket.org/marcomaggi/vicare-scheme/downloads">Bitbucket</a>.  They are
development prereleases from the <code>master</code> branch.  Their purpose is to make it
possible to build Vicare without installing the <acronym>GNU</acronym> Autotools.

<!--  -->
<h4 class="unnumberedsubsec">Random thoughts for the future: reproducible builds</h4>

<p>I have <a href="https://reproducible-builds.org/">read</a> about it; I have thought about
it.  It is an interesting initiative; it is not easy to implement in Vicare; if it
were easy I would implement it right away.  There are some minor issues with the
build date included in the <acronym>REPL</acronym> greetings and some gensyms used as property keys. 
The real issues are:

     <ul>
<li>The gensyms generated by the expander and used in the data structures representing
syntactic bindings.  Gensyms embed random strings: these random strings are different
at every build.  Most likely there are ways to make these &ldquo;random&rdquo; strings
deterministic by associating them to the lexical context for which they are
generated; but nothing quick to implement comes to my mind now.

     <li>Some C code is included or excluded depending on the availability of system functions
on the host platform (<acronym>POSIX</acronym> stuff and similar). 
</ul>

   <p>Most likely there are other problems.
